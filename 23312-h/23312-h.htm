<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The Table of Contents sufficiently indicates the purpose
and aim of this book. The essays are the thoughts of
American women, of wide and varied experience, both
professional and otherwise; no one writer being responsible
for the work of another. The connecting link is the
common interest. Some of the names need no introduction.
The author of Essay IV. has had an unusually
long and varied experience in the education and care of
Western girls, in schools and colleges. The author of the
essay on English Girls is a graduate of Antioch, has
taught for many years in different sections of this country,
and has had unusual opportunities, for several years, of
observing English methods and results.</p>

<p>The essays on the first four institutions, whose names
they bear, come with the official sanction of the presiding
officers of those institutions, who vouch for the correctness
of the statements. Of these, VII. is by a member
of the present Senior Class of the University, who has instituted
very exact personal inquiries among the women-students.
The author of VIII. is the librarian of Mt.
Holyoke Seminary. The writer of the report from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Oberlin is a graduate&mdash;a teacher of wide experience, and
has been for three or four years the Principal of the
Ladies' Department of the college. The resident physician
at Vassar is too well known as such, to need any
introduction.</p>

<p>There are many other institutions whose statistics
would be equally valuable, such, for instance, as the
Northwestern University of Illinois, which has not only
opened its doors to girl-students, but has placed women
on the Board of Trustees, and in the Faculty.</p>

<p>From Antioch, which we desired to have fully represented,
we have been disappointed in obtaining statistics,
which may, however, hereafter be embodied in a second
edition. In place thereof, we give the brief statement
of facts found under the name of the institution, supplied
by a friend.</p>

<p>With reference to my own part of the volume, if the
words on &ldquo;Physical Education&rdquo; far outnumber those
on the &ldquo;Culture of the Intellect,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Culture of
the Will,&rdquo; it can only be said that the American nation
are far more liable to overlook the former than the latter
two, and that the number of pages covered is by no
means to be taken as an index of the relative importance
of the divisions in themselves. Of the imperfection of
all three, no one can be more conscious than their author.
The subject is too large for any such partial treatment.</p>

<p>To friends, medical, clerical, and unprofessional, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
have kindly given me the benefit of their criticism on
different parts of the introductory essay, my thanks are
due. Especially do I recognize my obligation to Dr. W.
Gill Wylie, of this city, whose line of study and practice
has made his criticism of great value.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from adding that I am fully aware of
the one-sided nature of the training acquired in the profession
of teaching. Civilization, implying, as it does, division
of labor, necessarily renders all persons more or
less one-sided. In the teaching profession, the voluntary
holding of the mind for many hours of each day in the
position required for the work of educating uneducated
minds, the constant effort to state facts clearly, distinctly,
and freed from unnecessary details, almost universally
induce a straightforwardness of speech, which savors, to
others who are not immature, of brusqueness and positiveness,
if it may not deserve the harsher names of asperity
and arrogance. It is not these in essence, though
it appear to be so, and thus teachers often give offense
and excite opposition when these results are farthest from
their intention. In the case of these essays, this professional
tendency may also have been aggravated by the circumstances
under which they have been written, the only
hours available for the purpose having been the last three
evening hours of days whose freshness was claimed by
actual teaching, and the morning hours of a short vacation.</p>

<p>I do not offer these explanations as an apology, simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
as an explanation. No apology has the power to make
good a failure in courtesy. If passages failing in this be
discovered, it will be cause for gratitude and not for
offense if they are pointed out.</p>

<p>The spirit which has prompted the severe labor has
been that which seeks for the Truth, and endeavors to
express it, in hopes that more perfect statements may be
elicited.</p>

<p>With these words, I submit the result to the intelligent
women of America, asking only that the screen of the
honest purpose may be interposed between the reader and
any glaring faults of manner or expression.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">the</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Education of American</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Girls</span>.</h2>

<p>There seems to be at present no subject more capable
of exciting and holding attention among thoughtful people
in America, than the question of the Education of
Girls. We may answer it as we will, we may refuse to
answer it, but it will not be postponed, and it will be heard;
and until it is answered on more rational grounds than that
of previous custom, or of preconceived opinion, it may be
expected to present itself at every turn, to crop out of
every stratum of civilized thought. Nor is woman to
blame if the question of her education occupies so much
attention. The demands made are not hers&mdash;the continual
agitation is not primarily of her creating. It is simply the
tendency of the age, of which it is only the index. It
would be as much out of place to blame the weights of a
clock for the moving of the hands, while, acted upon by
an unseen, but constant force, they descend slowly but
steadily towards the earth.</p>

<p>That this is true, is attested by the widely-spread discussion
and the contemporaneous attempts at reform in
widely-separated countries. While the women in America
are striving for a more complete development of their
powers, the English women are, in their own way, and
quite independently, forcing their right at least to be examined
if not to be taught, and the Russian women are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
asserting that the one object toward which they will bend
all their efforts of reform is &ldquo;the securing of a solid
education from the foundation up.&rdquo; When the water
in the Scotch lakes rises and falls, as the quay in Lisbon
sinks, we know that the cause of both must lie far below,
and be independent of either locality.</p>

<p>The agitation of itself is wearisome, but its existence
proves that it must be quieted, and it can be so quieted
only by a rational solution, for every irrational decision,
being from its nature self-contradictory, has for its chief
mission to destroy itself. As long as it continues, we
may be sure that the true solution has not been attained,
and for our hope we may remember that we</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;have seen all winter long the thorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First show itself intractable and fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after, bear the rose upon its top.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We, however, are chiefly concerned with the education
of our own girls, of girls in America. Born and bred
in a continent separated by miles of ocean from the traditions
of Europe, they may not unnaturally be expected
to be of a peculiar type. They live under peculiar
conditions of descent, of climate, of government,
and are hence very different from their European sisters.
No testimony is more concurrent than that of observant
foreigners on this point. More nervous, more sensitive,
more rapidly developed in thinking power, they scarcely
need to be stimulated so much as restrained; while, born
of mixed races, and reared in this grand meeting-ground
of all nations, they gain at home, in some degree, that
breadth which can be attained in other countries only by
travel. Our girls are more frank in their manners, but
we nowhere find girls so capable of teaching intrusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and impertinence their proper places, and they combine
the French nerve and force with the Teutonic simplicity
and truthfulness. Less accustomed to leading-strings,
they walk more firmly on their own feet, and, breathing
in the universal spirit of free inquiry, they are less in
danger of becoming unreasonable and capricious.</p>

<p>Such is the material, physical and mental, which we
have to fashion into womanhood by means of education.
But is it not manifest in the outset, that no system based
on European life can be adequate to the solution of such
a problem? Our American girls, if treated as it is perfectly
correct to treat French or German girls, are
thwarted and perverted into something which has all the
faults of the German and French girl, without her excellencies.
Our girls will not blindly obey what seem to
them arbitrary rules, and we can rule them only by winning
their conviction. In other words, they will rule
themselves, and it therefore behooves us to see that they
are so educated that they shall do this wisely. They are
not continually under the eye of a guardian. They are
left to themselves to a degree which would be deemed in
other countries impracticable and dangerous. We cannot
follow them everywhere, and therefore, more than in any
other country must we educate them, so that they will
follow and rule themselves. But no platform of premise
and conclusion, however logical and exact, is broad enough
to place under an uneducated mind. Nothing deserving
the name of conviction can have a place in such. Prejudices,
notions, prescriptive rules, may exist there, but
these are not sufficient as guides of conduct.</p>

<p>Education, of course, signifies, as a glance at the etymology
of the word shows us, a development&mdash;an unfolding
of innate capacities. In its process it is the gradual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
transition from a state of entire dependence, as at birth,
to a state of independence, as in adult life. Being a
general term, it includes all the faculties of the human
being, those of his mortal, and of his immortal part. It
is a training, as well of the continually changing body,
which he only borrows for temporary use from material
nature, and whose final separation is its destruction, as of
the changeless essence in which consists his identity, and
which, from its very nature, is necessarily immortal. The
education of a girl is properly said to be finished when
the pupil has attained a completely fashioned will, which
will know how to control and direct her among the exigencies
of life, mental power to judge and care for herself
in every way, and a perfectly developed body. However
true it may be, that life itself, by means of daily
exigencies, will shape the Will into habits, will develop to
some extent the intelligence, and that the forces of nature
will fashion the body into maturity; we apply the term
Education only to the voluntary training of one human
being who is undeveloped, by another who is developed,
and it is in this sense alone that the process can concern
us. For convenience, then, the subject will be considered
under three main heads, corresponding to the triple
statement made above.</p>

<p>Especially is it desirable to place all that one may have
to say of the education of girls in America on some
proved, rational basis, for in no country is the work of
education carried on in so purely empirical a way. We
are deeply impressed with its necessity; we are eager in
our efforts, but we are always in the condition of one
&ldquo;whom too great eagerness bewilders.&rdquo; We are ready
to drift in any direction on the subject. We adopt every
new idea that presents itself. We recognize our errors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in one direction, and in our efforts to prevent those we
fall into quite as dangerous ones on the other side. More
than in any other country, then, it were well for us to
follow in the paths already laid out by the thinkers of
Germany. I shall, therefore, make no apology for using
as guide the main divisions of the great philosophers of
that nation, who alone, in modern times, have made for
Education a place among the sciences. Truth is of no
country, but belongs to whoever can comprehend it.</p>

<p>Nor do I apologize for speaking of what may be called
small things nor for dealing with minor details. &ldquo;When
the fame of Heraclitus was celebrated throughout Greece,
there were certain persons that had a curiosity to see so
great a man. They came, and as it happened, found
him warming himself in a kitchen. The meanness of
the place occasioned them to stop, upon which the philosopher
thus accosted them: 'Enter,' said he, 'boldly,
for here too there are gods!'&rdquo; Following so ancient and
wise an authority, I also say to myself in speaking of
these things which seem small and mean: Enter boldly,
for here too there are gods; nay, perchance we shall
thereby enter the very temple of the goddess Hygeia
herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>PHYSICAL EDUCATION,</h2>
<h3>OR,<br />
THE CULTURE OF THE BODY.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;H&aelig;c ante exitium primis dant signa diebus.&rdquo;&mdash;Virgil.</p></div>
<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Now my belief is&mdash;and this is a matter upon which I should
like to have your opinion, but my own belief is&mdash;not that the good
body improves the soul, but that the good soul improves the body.
What do you say?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Plato, Rep. Book III.</span></p></div>
<br />

<p>If we could literally translate the German word <i>Fertigkeiten</i>
into Readinesses, and use it as a good English
word, we should then have a term under which to group
many arts of which a fully educated woman should have
some knowledge&mdash;I mean cooking, sewing, sweeping,
dusting, etc. When a woman is mistress of these, she
is called <i>capable</i>, that good old word, heard oftener in
New England than elsewhere, which carries with it a sweet
savor of comfort and rest. Some knowledge of these
should undoubtedly constitute a part of the education of
our girls; but the &ldquo;how much&rdquo; is a quantity which varies
very materially as the years go by. For instance, the art
of knitting stockings was considered in the days of our
grandmothers one to which much time must be devoted,
and those of us who were born in New England doubtless
well recollect the time when, to the music of the tall old
kitchen clock, we slowly, laboriously and yet triumphantly,
&ldquo;bound off&rdquo; our first heel, or &ldquo;narrowed off&rdquo; our first
toe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>But weaving machines can do this work now with far
greater precision; and while stockings are so good and
so cheap, is it worth while for our girls to spend long
hours in the slow process of looping stitches into each
other? Would not the same time be better spent in the
open air and the sunshine, than in-doors, with cramped
fingers and bent back over the knitting-needles?</p>

<p>Of Sewing, nearly the same might be said, since the
invention of machines for the purpose. Sewing is a fine
art, and those of us who can boast of being neat seamstresses
do confess to a certain degree of pride in the
boast. But the satisfaction arises from the well-doing,
and not from the fact that it is Sewing well done; for
anything well and thoroughly done, even if it be only
boot-blacking on a street corner, or throwing paper torpedoes
in a theatre orchestra to imitate the crack of a
whip in the &ldquo;Postilion Galop,&rdquo; gives to its doer the same
sense of self-satisfaction. It would be folly now, as it
may have been in old times, for our girls to spend their
hours and try their eyes over back-stitching for collars,
etc., when any one out of a hundred cheap machines can
do it not only in less time but far better, and the money
which could be saved in many ways, by wisdom in
housekeeping and caring for the health of children,
would buy a machine for every family. This matter of
stitching being done for us, then, we may say that the
other varieties of sewing required are very few: &ldquo;sewing
over-and-over,&rdquo; or &ldquo;top-stitching&rdquo; as the Irish call it,
hemming, button sewing, button-hole making, and gathering.
Indeed, hemming, including felling, might be
also omitted, as, with a very few exceptions, hems and
fells are also handed over to the rapid machine; and
&ldquo;over-casting&rdquo; is but a variety of &ldquo;top-stitching.&rdquo; There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
are then only four things which a girl really needs to be
taught to do, so far as the mere manual facility goes&mdash;&ldquo;to
sew over-and-over;&rdquo; to put on a button; to gather,
including &ldquo;stroking&rdquo; or &ldquo;laying,&rdquo; and to make a button-hole.
Does it not seem as if an intelligent girl of
fourteen or fifteen could be taught these in twelve
lessons of one hour each? Only practice can give rapidity
and perfection; but at the age mentioned, the girl's
hand has been pretty thoroughly educated to obey her
will, and but very little time is needed to turn the acquired
control into this peculiar activity, while, with the
untrained muscles of the little child, much more time is
required and much fretfulness engendered, born of the
confined position and the almost insuperable difficulty
of the achievement.</p>

<p>Above the mere manual labor, however, there comes
another work which always has to be done for the child,
and is therefore of no educational value for her: I mean
the &ldquo;fitting&rdquo; and &ldquo;basting.&rdquo; They cannot be intrusted to
the child, for the simple reason that they involve not
merely manual dexterity, but also an exercise of the
judgment, which in the child has not yet become sufficiently
developed. But when the girl has lived fourteen
years, we will say, and has been trained in other ways
into habits of neatness and order, she has also acquired
judgment enough for the purpose, and needs only a few
words of direction. The sewing of bands to gathers,
the covering of cord, the cording of neck or belt, the
arrangement of two edges for felling, the putting on of
bindings, belong, so to speak, to the syntax of the art
of sewing, and come under this division, which must,
perforce, be left till maturer years than those of childhood.
There is still a sphere above this, the three cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>responding
exactly to apprenticeship, journeymanship
and mastership, in learning a trade. The third and last
sphere is that of &ldquo;cutting,&rdquo; and this demands simply
and only, judgment and caution. There are a few
general statements which must be given, as, for instance,
&ldquo;the right way of the cloth,&rdquo; in which the parts of the
garment should be cut, etc.; but these being once learned&mdash;and
a lesson of one hour would be a large allowance for
this purpose&mdash;the good cutter is the one who has the
most exact eye for measurement&mdash;trained already in
school by drawing, writing, etc.&mdash;the best power of calculation&mdash;trained
by arithmetic, algebra, etc.&mdash;and the
best observation and judgment&mdash;trained by every study
she has pursued under a good teacher.</p>

<p>As to sewing, considered as a physical exercise, it
may almost be pronounced bad in its very nature;
considered as a mental exercise, in its higher spheres, it
is excellent, because it calls for the activity of thought;
but after the cutting and fitting are done, it is undoubtedly
bad, leaving the mind free to wander wherever it
will. The constant, mechanical drawing through of the
needle, like the listening to a very dull address, seems to
induce a kind of morbid intellectual acuteness, or nervousness.
If the inner thought is entirely serene and
happy, this may do no harm; but if it is not, if there is
any internal annoyance or grief, the mind turns it over
and over, till, like a snow-ball, it grows to a mountainous
mass, and too heavy to be borne with patience. I think
many women will testify, from a woman's experience,
that there are times when an afternoon spent in sewing
gives some idea of incipient insanity. This lengthy discussion
of the woman's art of sewing can only be excused
on the ground that it touches the question of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
physical and mental health. As a means of support,
the needle can hardly be spoken of now.</p>

<p>As to Cooking, the same in substance might be said.
It is perhaps a little more mechanical in its nature, though
of that I am not positive; but if a girl is educated into a
full development of what is known as common sense, she
can turn that common sense in this direction as well as
in any other, if the necessity arises. The parts of cooking
which call for judgment&mdash;such, for instance, as
whether cake is stiff enough or not, whether the oven is
hot enough, safely to intrust the mixture to its care,
whether the bread is sufficiently risen&mdash;require the same
kind of trained senses as that by which the workman in
the manufacture of steel decides as to the precise color
and shade at which he must withdraw it for use. To
quote from an English woman:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> &ldquo;Cookery is not a
branch of general education for women or for men,
but for technical instruction for those who are to follow
the profession of cookery; and those who attempt to
make it a branch of study for women generally, will be
but helping to waste time and money, and adding to that
sort of amateur tinkering in domestic work which is one
of the principal causes of the inefficiency of our domestic
servants * * *  The intellectual and moral
habits necessary to form a good cook and housekeeper
are thoughtfulness, method, delicacy and accuracy of
perception, good judgment, and the power of readily
adapting means to ends, which, with Americans, is termed
'faculty,' and with Englishmen bears the homelier name
of 'handiness.' Morally, they are conscientiousness,
command of temper, industry and perseverance; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
these are the very qualities a good school education
must develop and cultivate. The object of such an education
is not to put into the pupils so much History,
Geography, French or Science, but, through these studies,
to draw out their intelligence, train them to observe
facts correctly, and draw accurate inferences from their
observation, which constitutes good judgment, and teach
them to think, and to apply thought easily to new forms
of knowledge. Morally, the discipline of a good school
tends directly to form the habits I mentioned above.
The pupils are trained to steady industry and perseverance,
to scorn dishonest work, and to control temper.
The girls who leave school so trained, though they may
know nothing of cooking or housekeeping, will become
infinitely better cooks and housekeepers, as soon as they
have a motive for doing so, than the uneducated woman,
who has learned only the technical rules of her craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every girl ought certainly also to know how to drive
a nail, to put in and take out a screw, and to do various
other things of the same kind, as well as to sweep and
to dust; but of all these &ldquo;readinesses,&rdquo; if I may be permitted
the word, the same thing may be said. I have
spoken of them under Physical education, as their most
appropriate place.</p>

<p>Passing now to the more definite consideration of
Physical education, it will be convenient to consider this
division of the subject under three heads, as I have to
speak of</p>

<div style="margin-left: 12em;">
<ol><li>Repair,</li>
<li>Exercise,</li>
<li>Sexual Education.</li></ol>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<h3>REPAIR.</h3><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>All parts of the body are, of course, as long as life exists,
in a state of continual wear, old cells being constantly broken
down, and new ones substituted in their places. When
the Apostle exclaimed, &ldquo;I die daily,&rdquo; he uttered an important
physiological as well as a spiritual truth; though,
if he had said, &ldquo;I die every instant,&rdquo; he would have
expressed it more exactly. It is only by continual death
that we live at all. But continual death calls for continual
creation, the continual destruction for continual
repair, and this is rendered possible by means of food
and sleep. Clothing, too, properly belongs under this
division; for, were it not for this, the heat of the body
would often be carried off faster than it could be generated,
and the destructive process would outstrip the
reconstructive. Moreover, the clothing too frequently
interferes with the normal functions of the most important
repairing organs, and its consideration, therefore,
must constitute the third branch of our inquiry. The
division <i>Repair</i>, then, will embrace a consideration of</p>

<div style="margin-left: 12em;"><ol type="a"><li>Food,</li>
<li>Sleep,</li>
<li>Clothing.</li></ol></div>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;The kind and quantity of food must obviously
vary with age, temperament, and the season. But three
general rules may be laid down as of prime importance:
the meals should be regular in their occurrence; they
should be sufficiently near together to prevent great
hunger, and absolutely nothing should be taken between
them. An exception may, however, be safely made to
this last rule, with regard to young children, in this wise,
making a rule which I have known as established in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
families. &ldquo;If the children are hungry enough to eat
dry bread, they can have as much as they want at any
time; if they are not, they are far better off without
anything.&rdquo; These are the plainest rules of Physiology,
and yet how few of the girls around us are made to
follow them! Nothing is more sure to produce a disordered
digestion, than the habit of irregular eating or
drinking. If possible, the growing girl should have her
dinner in the middle of the day. The exigencies of city
life make this arrangement in some cases inconvenient,
and yet inconvenience is less often than is popularly
supposed synonymous with impracticability. If this
cannot be done, and luncheons must be carried to school,
the filling of the lunch-basket should never be left, except
under exact directions, to the kind-hearted servant,
or to the girl herself; and she should under no circumstances
be allowed to buy her luncheon each day of the
baker, or the confectioner, a usual practice twenty years
ago of the girls in Boston private schools.</p>

<p>There are children and young girls who are said to have
cravings for certain kinds of food, not particularly nutritious,
but in ninety-nine per cent of these cases the cause
of the morbid appetite can be found in the want of proper
direction in childhood. The fact is, that <i>the formation
of a healthy appetite is properly a subject of education</i>.
The physical taste of the little girl needs rational direction
as well as her mental taste, though mothers too often
do not recognize the fact. It would seem almost like
an insult to the intelligence of my readers, to say, that
warm bread of whatever kind, pastry, confectionery,
nuts, and raisins, should form no part of a girl's diet;
did we not every day, not only in restaurants and hotels,
but at private tables, see our girls fed upon these articles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The German child, in the steady German climate, may
drink perhaps with impunity, beer, wine, tea and coffee;
but to our American girls, with their nervous systems
stung into undue activity by the extremes of our climate,
and the often unavoidable conditions of American
society, these should all be unknown drinks. The time
will come soon enough, when the demands of adult life
will create a necessity for these indispensable accompaniments
of civilization; but before the time when the girl
enters upon the active duties of a woman, they only
stimulate to debilitate.</p>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated, that the appetite and
the taste for certain kinds of food are, to a greater degree
than is usually acknowledged, merely the results of education;
and the mother who sees her daughter pale and
sickly, and falling gradually under the dominion of dyspepsia,
in any of its multitudinous forms or results, and
who seeks the physician's aid, has too often only her own
neglect to blame, when the medicines fail to cure.
From the food is manufactured the blood; from the
blood all parts of the living tissue of every organ; not
only bone and muscle cells, but nerve cells are built up
from it, and if the blood be not of the best quality,
either from the fact that the food was not of proper material
or properly digested, not only the digestive organs,
but the whole system, will be weak. Moreover, those
organs which await for their perfect development a later
time than the others will be most apt to suffer from the
result of long-established habits, and it is as true of the
human body as of a chain, that no matter where the
strain comes, it will break at its weakest part. The truth
of what is here stated may be illustrated by the teeth,
which are formed at different periods of life. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
have a perfect set of what are known as first teeth; but
in too many children in our American homes, the second
teeth make their first appearance in a state of incipient
decay, while it has become almost proverbial, that the
wisdom teeth are of no use, except to the dentist.
Mothers have only to consult easily procured books to
learn the kinds of food most easily digestible, and most
nourishing. That they do not do so, results from the seeming
general belief, that this matter of eating will take care
of itself, and that it does not come within the province
of education. The whole matter lies in the hands of
women. The physician can do but little, because he can
know but little. It is the intelligent women of America
who must realize the evil, and must right the wrong, if
we would see our girls what we most earnestly desire
them to be&mdash;perfectly healthy and well developed.</p>

<p>Again, the cure of many diseases, especially those
which are prevalent in the summer months, belongs
more to the women of the household than to the physician.
They alone can check the evil at its commencement.
Every educated woman ought to know, for instance,
that cracked wheat and hominy, oat-meal, corn-bread,
and Graham bread, should not, as a general rule,
be made the staple of diet in case of what is popularly
known as &ldquo;summer complaint&rdquo;; and yet, how few girls
seem to have any idea, when they are thus sick, that it
is a matter of the least consequence what they eat, or that
they ought not to make their breakfast of Boston brown
bread; and by how few of our girls is it considered a
matter of any moment that the opposite trouble exists
for days. Ought they not to be educated to know that
they can devise no surer way of poisoning the whole
system, and then of straining all the contiguous organs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
than by wilful neglect in this direction? When some
facts are obvious, and some are latent, the blame, if
trouble exists, is not unnaturally laid on the visible
facts. It is evident to the physician that the girl has
attended school. It is not so evident that, since her
earliest childhood, she has been fed on improper food, at
irregular hours, and that the processes by which the
poisonous dead matter is removed from the system, have
been irregularly carried on. His questions put on these
topics are put in a general way, and answered in the
same, with, perhaps, a worse than foolish mock-modesty
to prompt the reply. He does the best that he can, but
he cannot help stumbling, if he is required to walk in
the dark. This false shame of which I speak, on this
matter, seems to be a folly peculiarly American, and I
am quite sure that it is not so common now as it was
twenty years ago, though there are still many American
women who would choose to run the risk of making
themselves sick rather than to tread the folly out under
a pure womanly scorn. This is also a matter which belongs
to education.</p>

<p>One great trouble with our American girls, and one
which can be remedied by us, though we cannot remedy
the climate, is not that their brains are overworked, but
that their bodies generally, including brain, are underfed.
I do not mean that they do not eat enough in
bulk, though that is often the case, but that they do not
take in enough of the chemical elements which they
must have to build up the system. Their food is not
sufficiently nutritious, and the energy of the digestive
organs is wasted in working upon material which, if it
does not irritate and inflame, is at least of no economic
value, and is simply rejected by the system; or, worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
still, in default of better, it is absorbed, and the whole
blood becomes poisoned. Sometimes our girls do not
eat often enough. For instance, a girl who, after tea,
has been obliged to employ her brain in unusually hard
work, might probably be helped by eating some nourishing
food before sleep. If she do not, the result will
not infrequently be that she will awake tired and languid;
she will sit idly at the breakfast table, play with
her knife and fork, and feel only disgust at the food provided.
She may soon suffer from, if she does not complain
of, back-ache and other attendant troubles, the
simple result of weakness. It is only Micawber's old
statement over again: &ldquo;Annual income, twenty pounds,
annual expenditure, twenty pounds, ought, and six; result&mdash;Misery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a long course of this kind, the physician is
summoned, and the girl is forbidden to study. But
it seldom occurs to any one that if <big>5 - 8 = -3,</big> the
two may be made equal just as easily by adding the
three to the five as by subtracting it from the eight, <i>i.e.</i>,
although we, as a nation, are supposed to be, at least,
more conversant with arithmetic than with any branch
of school study, though we do know that <big>8 &gt; 5</big>, we do
not see that <big>5 + 3 = 8</big>, and so we try to cancel the
offending <big>-3</big> by diminishing the <big>8</big>. But would not the
other process be quite as rational? Physical life is only
a simple balance of forces, the expenditure and nourishment
corresponding exactly to demand and supply in
the Science of Political Economy.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They tend continually
to level themselves. Have we not the right to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
decide in which way the leveling shall be effected&mdash;the
equation be formed? This is a simple solution of the
difficulty. I suggest that this experiment be tried: let
the girl study her extra time in the evening, if she
desires, only being cautious that she do not infringe
upon her sleep hours; then give her a supper of bread
and butter and cold meat, and send her to bed. If her
digestive organs are in good state, she will very possibly
sleep a sound and dreamless sleep, and rise refreshed in
the morning, with a good appetite for her breakfast.
By this simple hygienic remedy, aching backs may not
only be prevented, they may be gradually cured. I am
stating actual facts. If the evening be spent in conversation,
or mere lounging over books, the supper will not
be needed, and will prove, if taken, only a burden; but
if, as has already been said, it be spent in actual brain-work,
the tremendous and unusual strain on the whole
nervous system, occasioned by the destruction of nerve-cells,
must be made good, or those organs most intimately
connected with the nervous system and the sources of
life, will be sure to suffer. It must, however, be repeated
here, if we would secure the good results desired, that
the supper must be of <i>nourishing</i>, not of stimulating food.</p>

<p>Even the destruction, through exercise, of the inferior
muscle-cells demands food before sleeping. It is no
merely fashionable custom which calls the dancers at an
evening entertainment to the loaded supper-table, as
those of my readers who have attended the so-called
cold-water Sociables will bear me witness. It may be
seriously questioned whether the regulation which forbade
any refreshment except cold water was not, like
many other unthinking, economical plans, really no
economy at all. Instead of one pantry's furnishing food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to the famished dancers, this was furnished for each one at
home, from her own mother's private stores, and as the
members of the Sociables met at each other's houses in
order, the total result of expenditure to each family, at
the close of the winter, was probably the same as it
would have been, had each family furnished, on one
evening, a moderate entertainment of the same sort to
the bankrupt systems. Fashion is often wiser than we
think her, especially when at parties for the &ldquo;German&rdquo;
she prescribes a cup of beef-tea as the regulation refreshment.</p>

<p>A long, rapid walk in the evening, as we all know,
will produce the same effect. We return, and remark
that we are hungry, merely meaning that we have received
polite official notice that our physical bank account
has been overdrawn. If we do not pay any attention to
this notification, we shall surely in time be passed from
adversary to judge, and from judge to officer, and finally
be cast literally into a prison from which, unlike some of
our city prisons, we shall not escape till we have paid the
uttermost farthing. Then we shall be likely to receive
from the kindly friend whom we summon to visit us,
wise and good advice, on the extravagance of spending
so much. But might not the advice be possibly quite
as useful if delivered in this wise: &ldquo;Why don't you
earn more, and make larger deposits.&rdquo; The force of
weakness compels us to stop spending our muscle cells;
the kind friend, as far as is possible, puts a stop to the
expenditure of nerve cells, and draws on the funds derived
from the Cinchona forests of South America and
the iron mountains of Missouri, to make new deposits
on our account; and when the matter is thus doubly settled
for us by nature and science, we go on our way re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>joicing,
only to repeat the same insane folly. But it is
not good for one's credit to overdraw too frequently her
bank account; and there may come a time when suspension
means bankruptcy, and when all the kindness and
skill of all our friends can be no longer of any avail. Is
it not our own fault, and shall we not so educate our
girls that they shall not fall into it, since they comprehend
its unreason?</p>

<p>We are undoubtedly creatures of habit; but we
oftener apply the word to our mental and moral
than to our physical nature, and wrongly. When regular
and constant demands are made upon any organ of
the body, the body, as it were, falls into the habit of
laying in enough force in that particular department for
that particular purpose, as the scientific steward at
Vassar lays in for each day so many pounds of beef or
mutton, because he can rely with certainty on its consumption.
If in any case the demand is, for any reason,
slackened, there is a surplus of energy which must find
a vent, or render its possessor very uncomfortable. Need
mothers be reminded of how very troublesome the little
girl becomes in a short school vacation, or during the
first days of a long one? Or need teachers be told that
it is only a loss of time in the end, to assign at the commencement
of the September term lessons of the same
length as those which were learned with no difficulty in
June? There is a decided inertia in the bodily functions,
and time is required for a sudden change. Inconvenience
in such a case will be sure to arise, unless the surplus
force be instantly directed into other and unobjectionable
channels.</p>

<p>If the reverse takes place, and the demand be suddenly
increased, the result is weakness, debility, and finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
disease; though precisely the same amount of work
might have been done, not only with safety but with
positive advantage, provided the increase of the demand
had been gradual.</p>

<p>Is there any country in the world equal to America
in the irregularity and spasmodic nature of the demands
which society makes upon its women? Are there any
girls in the world so ready to rush headlong into all
kinds of exercise, mental or physical, which may be
recommended to them, as our American girls? It is a
pity that, to balance our greater amount of fiery energy in
the matter of education, we have not a sounder philosophy.</p>

<p>Once more, physical life is only a balance of forces, as
spiritual life is a series of choices, and the question is
not simply how much intellectual or brain work we are
doing. This question cannot justly be considered apart
from the other inquiry, of how much appropriate material
we are supplying for the use of the brain. We
cannot judge whether the amount of force expended be
healthful or unhealthful till we know how much force
has been and can be generated. There is undoubtedly
a limit to this last factor in our problem, but if we do
not exceed this limit in our expenditure, it seems unquestionable,
that the more brain work we do, the better
will it be for the entire system, and the stronger will be
our health, this being only our power actively to resist
the destructive forces of nature.</p>

<p>The nervous system, at the head of which stands the
brain, is undoubtedly the regent of the monarchy of the
body, whose sovereign is the thinking spirit; and all the
organs in a well-regulated body should be worked in the
interest of the organ of thought, as servants for a wise
and watchful master. It seems sometimes as if we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in danger of forgetting that though &ldquo;the eye cannot say
unto the hand, I have no need of thee, nor again, the
head to the feet, I have no need of you,&rdquo; there will
come a time when the thinking spirit, grown to full
stature, shall say to all of them, &ldquo;I have no need any
longer of any of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The consideration of the subject of Ventilation properly
comes under this division, for pure air is as much
food for the body, as meat or bread. This whole matter,
however, seems to be practically not well understood, if
we may judge from the results so far, and no extended
discussion of the means will be in place there. It is sufficient
simply to indicate its immense importance. But
that bad air is likely to be a more active cause of disease
in America than elsewhere seems true, for in no other
country are furnaces and closed fire-places in so general
use. Moreover, the women and girls who spend most of
their lives in the house, will be expected to show the
evil effects more than the men and boys, who do not.
The practical suggestions on this point are apparent to
every one.</p>

<p>One more thing which the body, to be healthy, demands
for food is Sun-light, that invaluable medicine for
all forms of nervous disease, which Americans, more than
any other people, curtain carefully out for fear of fading
carpets and furniture. But what are French moquettes,
brocade, or satin, compared with rosy cheeks, clear complexions,
and steady nerves? If we would only draw
up the shades, open the shutters, and loop the heavy curtains
out of the way, or, better still, take them down
altogether, might we not look for a marked improvement
in systems affected by nervous diseases? This want of
sun-light may be expected also, of course, most to affect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
those who remain within doors, and who, even in walking,
shade themselves with veils and sun-shades from the
life-giving rays of the sun.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Sleep.</i>&mdash;To many of the organs of the body there have
been allotted seasons of comparative quiet and repose, even
during the day. If the rules for food be observed, the
stomach, for instance, has, as stomach, its vacations from
labor, by means of which it is enabled to prepare for,
and perform, its regularly recurring work with vigor.
Even with organs where this is not the case, the action
is slackened very materially at times, as in the case of
the heart and lungs during sleep. They must continue
to work, though more slowly, and the part of the nervous
system which carries on their involuntary and mechanical
action, has also then a partial relief. But the only rest
for the thinking brain is to be found in normal sleep.
From the instant when, in the morning, we become conscious
of the external world, to the instant late at night,
or, it may be, early in the morning, when we pass through
the gates of sleep, out from companionship, into an utter
solitude, it never rests from its work. Whether, by volition,
we summon all our intellectual power to the closest
attention, and turn, as it were, the whole energy of our
being into one thought-channel, till the organs of sense
become simply outside appendages which disturb the internal
self with no imported knowledge, or whether, lying
idly, as we say, on the sofa, we let our thoughts wander
as they will, thought still goes on. Coming and going
more rapidly than the shortest pendulum can swing, inter-weaving
more subtly than the threads of the most complicated
lace under the fingers of the skillful worker; &ldquo;trains
of thought&rdquo; pass and repass through our minds, following,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
as we mechanically express it, the Laws of Association.
Only in losing consciousness, do we cease to destroy
the brain cells; it is only in sleep that the brain can
rest.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that the matter which is thus
destroyed, is, as Maudsley<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> so finely shows, the very finest
result of the creative life-process, the most precious essence.
It is like the oil of roses, to produce one drop of
which, unnumbered roses must be crushed. The force
required to produce a nerve cell is said to be immeasurably
greater than that demanded for a cell of muscle, of
bone, or of cartilage. In the nerve cells, lies not only
the directive force of the whole complicated machinery,
but the material with which the creative intelligence must
work. Let us also remember that our waking hours far
outnumber those spent in sleep, and we shall begin to
realize the immense importance of sleep, even to the fully
developed organism. But when we add to the mere
labor of repairing the daily waste, the task of construction,
which has to be performed during the years of
growth, we shall only deepen the impression. I believe
that every school-girl under eighteen years of age, and
many over that age, should have at least nine hours of
uninterrupted sleep in pure air, and the younger ones
need even more.</p>

<p>Much, at least doubtful, advice, has been given on the
subject of early rising. That the system which has, perhaps,
taken no food since six in the evening, should be
ready for any amount of labor in the morning before
breakfast, does not seem a rational conclusion, and I believe
that many nervous diseases must be charged to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
idea, that there is virtue in early rising, this implying,
generally, either work before breakfast, or, at best, a shortening
of the hours of sleep. It should, however, be remembered
that in some cases, the greater amount of sun-light
obtained by rising with the sun, may, and probably
does, compensate for lack of other food. But when early
rising means, as it often does, rising long before the day
begins, this cannot be said, and sooner or later, the over
demand upon the system will make itself felt when it is
too late to remedy the evil.</p>

<p>The habit of <i>regular</i> sleep is also one which should
be formed by education. The child who is accustomed
to go to bed at a regular hour, will also generally form
the habit of falling asleep regularly.</p>

<p>If parties for children and young people could be
made fashionable under the name of <i>matin&eacute;es</i>, they
might not have bad results; but as they are at present
carried on, they are an unmitigated evil, and one that is
sapping to a fearful degree the nervous force of our girls.
What mother would give her little girl a cup of arsenic,
no matter how tearfully or earnestly she might plead?
The very idea of education lies in the directing of the
capricious and irrational instincts, the blind and ignorant
forces, into their proper channels, by the rational
and enlightened will of the educator. But if, instead of
this, the unformed will is made the guide, the very reverse
of education is taking place. It makes no difference
to the physical forces, however, whether the hours
lost from sleep be lost at a party or at a lecture, a sermon,
or tableaux for the benefit of foreign missions.
Nature makes no distinctions of motive. &ldquo;An eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth,&rdquo; is her motto. If one
opposes himself to her laws, the offender, not she, goes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
down; and as Sancho Panza very wisely remarks,
&ldquo;Whether the stone hit the jug, or the jug the stone,
it is bad for the jug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is remarked by all foreigners, that in America the
children rule the house. This is simply saying that we
are, as a general rule, an uneducated people; which is
undoubtedly true. When we learn the immense importance
of sleep to the health of our girls, and when
we know that our rational convictions should lead them,
and not their irrational desires, us, we shall hear less
about their breaking down in health as they grow toward
maturity. We shall see fewer pale faces and angular
forms; though they will probably never, while they
live in this climate, acquire the ruddy glow of the Englishwoman
or the German, or the rounded outlines of the
nations of Southern Europe.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Clothing.</i>&mdash;With the external form of the dress as to
cut, trimming, or color, this essay has nothing to do.
Unless a dress be cut so low in the neck that it becomes an
unhealthful exposure after taking off warmer clothing, it
in no wise concerns this branch of the subject. I wish
to speak only of the underclothing habitually worn
by our girls, and its mode of adjustment; these being,
as I believe, the causes of much exhaustion and disease.</p>

<p>If technical terms, uncomprehended by any class of
readers, be used, it is simply for the sake of brevity;
and because, as Kant says, &ldquo;completeness must not be
sacrificed to popularity,&rdquo; the attainment of which would
be &ldquo;a didactic triumph, attained only by omitting everything
complicated, and saying only what exists already
in the consciousness of every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two rules for clothing evidently are given when
we say, first, that it should be sufficiently warm to prevent
the heat generated by the body from being too
rapidly lost; and second, that it should be sufficiently
loose to allow unimpeded muscular action, whether voluntary
or involuntary. But it is very rare to find either
of these rules observed by girls, and it is also rare to
find mothers who are aware that their daughters are daily
violating them.</p>

<p>First, as to the warmth: Every girl who is to be
reared in this climate of extremes and sudden changes
should wear shirt and drawers of wool next her body,
and woolen stockings, during at least eight months of
the year.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The merino underclothing, so generally
worn, is preferable to cotton or linen, but all-wool flannel
is far better; and if trouble is anticipated from
shrinking and fulling, the use of red flannel will prevent
this entirely. I am not speaking of becomingness
and grace; I am speaking of health and conservation of
force. Each organism can generate but a certain amount
of vital force, and if a large proportion of this has to be
expended in keeping up the even temperature of the
body, a smaller part than otherwise will go to the carrying
on of the other functions. But relieve the system
from the continual drafts made upon it, resulting from
insufficient clothing, and it will be able to assume duties
to which before it found itself inadequate. Some exceptions
must be made to this statement in the case of
those to whose skins flannel proves an irritant&mdash;but they
are comparatively few; and even in these cases the flannel
could be worn outside, if not inside, of the cotton or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
linen underclothing. The mother who will see to it
that from her earliest years the girl is protected, over all
parts of her body, by flannel underclothing, may simply
prevent evils which, afterwards, she and the most skilful
physician combined will find themselves unable to overcome.
But the facts are, that, from the earliest days of
life, when the dimpled neck and arms must be admired
by visitors, through the days of childhood, when, dressed
during the coldest weather of winter in linen and white
cambric or piqu&eacute;, with her body unprotected from the
chill, the little girl is led slowly and properly up Fifth
Avenue, to the nights when, heated by dancing, she
exposes bare neck, shoulders and arms to draughts of
cool air, she is, as a general rule, never warmly enough
dressed for our climate. I repeat, then, that for proper
protection a girl should always be, during at least eight
months of our year, clothed, body, arms, legs, and feet,
in wool; and pass to the second thought on the subject&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
clothing with regard to the mechanical effects of
pressure.</p>

<p>We have been continually told that our girls ought not
to wear corsets. It has been well said by some woman,
that if a man could succeed in fashioning a woman
exactly as, according to his theories, she ought to be
fashioned, he would not admire her after the work was
done; and though the remark was made only with
regard to intellectual education, it can be well applied to
this subject of corsets. If now, at this present moment,
all women were to satisfy this demand, and leave off
their corsets, the very men who entreated them to do
so, would at once entreat them to resume them. The
truth is, that it is not the corsets in themselves that are
injurious; they become so only when they are so tightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
drawn that they prevent free inspiration, or when, by
their great pressure, they force the yielding ribs from
their normal curve, compress the lungs, and displace the
organs of the abdomen, crowding them into the pelvis,
and thus displacing or bending out of shape the organs
therein contained. Let the girls keep on their corsets,
but instead of the unyielding cotton, linen, or silk braid,
let these be laced by round silk elastic cord. They will
then give support where it is needed, and yet will yield
freely to the expansion of the chest, returning again as
the air is expelled, and so preventing discomfort. This
is a very simple expedient, and yet perfectly successful,
and the girl who has tried it for three days will discard
the inelastic braid forever. I say elastic cord, and not
ribbon, because the elastic ribbon is too strong, and
does not sufficiently yield.</p>

<p>Girls do not know that they dress too tightly. They
will repel indignantly the idea that they &ldquo;lace;&rdquo; and
yet, if they be asked to take a full inhalation, it becomes
perfectly evident that the outside resistance is a
very positive element. To prove this, it is only necessary
for them to put on their corsets laced as above described,
and then try to button the dress. It will, in
nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand,
be found, I think, that the dress, which before came together
without the slightest difficulty, will no longer
meet. There is necessary no other proof that an unnatural
pressure has been habitually used, although, from
the very fact that it has been so long habitual, the girls
are entirely unconscious of it. The Chinese women,
I suppose, are not conscious of their compressed feet,
and the two cases are exactly parallel. No dressmaker
knows the meaning of the words &ldquo;loosely fitting.&rdquo; She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
is not to be blamed. She looks at her work with an
artistic eye, as a Parisian glove-fitter looks at his, and
wrinkles are the one thing which she spends her life in
striving to avoid; and, as a general thing, she is not a
student of Wordsworth to the extent of assuming as her
motto,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">&ldquo;Nor shall she fail to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even in the motions of the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grace that shall mould the maiden's form<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By silent sympathy.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not enough to say to the dressmaker. &ldquo;Make it
perfectly easy and comfortable,&rdquo; and then trust to her
judgment that it will be all right. The only test for a
girl's clothing, as to tightness, should be, &ldquo;Can you take
a good, full breath, and not feel your clothes?&rdquo; If so,
they are loose enough; if not, let them out, and keep
on letting them out till you can. Nor is there the
slightest need that this kind of dressing involve &ldquo;dowdiness,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;slouchiness,&rdquo; a characteristic abhorrent to
every true woman. Every woman expresses her character
in her dress; and where &ldquo;slouchiness&rdquo; exists, it means
something more than comfortable dressing. It means a
lack of neatness and order, a want in the ideas of suitability.
It is sure to manifest itself in other ways, and
will not be prevented by dresses never so tightly fitting.</p>

<p>The next thing to be considered is the place of proper
support for the voluminous clothing below the waist.
This gives a certain definite weight in pounds and ounces
larger than is generally supposed, and as a result of the
law of gravitation, it would all fall if the tendency were
not counteracted by a corresponding pressure. This
pressure is almost universally being sustained by our
girls at the hips, and it comes just where the trunk has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
no longer, except in the spinal column, any bony support,
depending alone on the yielding muscles.</p>

<p>It is idle to assert that the corsets support the dependent
weight. In the old times, when corsets had shoulder-straps,
this assertion might have had a shadow of truth, but
now, when they never have them, their weight must
simply be added to the total amount of weight of skirts,
to find the number of pounds of downward pressure.
They serve only as a kind of fender to prevent the tightly
tied skirts from cutting into the muscle, and therefore,
conducing to prevent discomfort, only serve to delude
the girl into the belief that they hold up her skirts.
This weight, evidently, should be borne by the shoulders,
where the firmly-jointed skeleton, upheld from below,
offers a firm and safe support. But give a girl shoulder-straps,
and she finds the pressure over so small an area
on the shoulders unbearable, and besides, the process of
dressing becomes then a matter of almost as much complication
as the harnessing of a horse, when some inexperienced
person has done the unharnessing. Suspenders,
though answering the purpose perfectly for men, will
not answer for women, and even when made especially
for them, are found inconvenient. The girl should wear,
over her corsets, an under-waist, fitted precisely like the
waist-lining of a dress as to seams and &ldquo;biases,&rdquo; or &ldquo;darts.&rdquo;
It should be made of strong shirting, neatly corded at neck
and &ldquo;arm-seyes,&rdquo; and finished around the waist by a binding
of the width of an ordinary belt, set up over the waist
so as to have three thicknesses of cloth for buttons. To
these buttons, four or more in number, the skirts should be
hung. The weight comes then on the shoulders, and is
evenly distributed there, so that it is not felt. This statement,
of course, implies, that the waists are sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
large. Moreover, which is only an incidental matter, the
waist answers as a corset-cover, and as a dress-protector at
the same time, and in the winter, when dresses cannot be
washed, it becomes a matter of necessity to have something
to answer the latter purpose. In the summer, when
low linings are desirable, these waists can, of course, be
made low in the neck. The shoulder-support then becomes
narrower, but on the other hand, the weight of the
clothing to be supported is very much less than in the
winter, so that no inconvenience will be found. These
waists themselves can then, if desired, take the place of
linings for thin summer dresses, and if this be done,
another incidental advantage will be the greater ease and
nicety with which muslins and calicoes can be &ldquo;done up.&rdquo;
It should be borne in mind, that within twenty years the
weight of the dress-skirt has been also laid upon the hips.
Before that time, our dress-waists and skirts were made in
one. Of late years they have almost never been so made;
that is to say, the shoulders have had, so to speak, absolutely
nothing to do, and the hips and waist, everything.
In any case, skirts should be furnished with buttons, not
strings. It is too easy to draw a string a little tighter
than it should be drawn.</p>

<p>Another fashion which our girls have adopted of late
years, should be spoken of. As if they had gone to work
to discover the only way in which pressure could be increased,
they have discarded the old fashion of gartering
the stockings, and have buttoned these up by bands
of strong elastic ribbon, to a band placed around the
waist. This arrangement, it seems to me, exhausts all
the possibilities of dragging pressure around the waist,
and in this view, it may be looked upon as a negatively
encouraging feature. They have, certainly, in respect to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the support of clothing, done their very worst. They
are trying to the full their powers of endurance, and any
change must be for the better.</p>

<p>I was not to speak of external dress, but the skirt of
the outside dress, by the present fashion, must be taken
into consideration; and of its probable weight any skilful
person, who has any idea of the weight of bugles and
dry-goods, may make an estimate for himself, though his
estimate will probably fall far short of the truth.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>If our girls are to walk the same streets with their brothers,
is there any reason why the soles of their shoes
should not be of equal thickness? And yet no man
would think of wearing, at any time, except for house
slippers, soles as thin as those which many of our girls
habitually wear. Boston is much more satisfactory than
New York in this particular, if the contents of the merchant's
shelves are a safe index of the desires of his customers.
This is a matter which has been often spoken of,
and yet one which mothers and daughters seem practically
to ignore. Girls should be educated to wear clothing
suitable to the time and place, and then their &ldquo;habituated
instincts&rdquo; will lead them to demand and wear shoes of
proper thickness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Enough. It cannot be too often repeated that a girl
may call for anxiety, and often break in health at the
time when she develops into a woman, not because of
the special demand for strength made at that time, but
because the demands on the general system for strength
have been, for twelve or fifteen years, greater than the
system could supply. It is not the last straw that breaks
the camel's back, but it is all the straws. The mother
who has educated her daughter into a healthy appetite
for food, as to quality and quantity; who has educated
her into a healthy appetite for sleep; who has, through
constant watchfulness over her clothing, assured herself
that no undue demands were made upon the strength of
sustaining muscles, and the constructive and repairing
power of the general vital force, has no need of hours of
anxiety as to the girl's health, and will find no critical
periods in her life, for the hours of anxiety have already
been represented by minutes of wise and rational supervision
in all the previous years, and need not be spent
over again.</p>


<h3>EXERCISE.</h3><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Bodily exercise is in one sense a means of repair, inasmuch
as it quickens the circulation and respiration, and
makes the whole organism more active. The old maxim
that Exercise strengthens every power must not be
overlooked, as the arm of the rower or the wrist of the confirmed
croquet-player will testify. But it must also be remembered,
and this is a matter of prime importance, that
it is only <i>judicious</i> exercise which gives strength; and by
judicious exercise is meant that in which the parts exercised
are not too steadily on the strain, and that which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
regular. For instance, continual standing in one spot
is not judicious exercise for either man or woman, because
the muscles whose contraction is required to maintain
the body in an upright position, are kept for too
long a time in a state of action; the continual tension
prevents the free passage of the blood, and the uniformity
of the circulation is destroyed. Continual standing,
in the teaching profession at least, has broken down many
a man as well as many a woman. With women, and
especially with growing women, the danger is greater,
resulting, of course, from the greater breadth of the pelvis
and the less physical strength; and any woman who
persists in it, simply exhibits an amount of recklessness
which can be cured only by her own experience, and
never by the advice of others.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> If she had been better
educated, she would know better and act more wisely.
Secondly, exercise which is irregular or is used spasmodically,
is not judicious. If, for instance, our girls had
from their earliest childhood and during many months
of the year, been accustomed to skating, no harm would
probably result from it. But when, as was the case
some twenty years ago, a sudden fashion sprang up for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
this exercise, and girls in all parts of the Northern
States insisted upon learning to skate, with untrained
muscles, and to skate for hours together during the
freezing intervals of our uncertain climate, an immense
amount of harm was actually done, the results of which
multitudes of women in Boston and New York are to-day
enduring.</p>

<p>There are, it is to be presumed, forms of exercise
which are not judicious from their very nature; but I find
myself at a loss to name any one which girls desire, or
in which they indulge, that would properly fall under
this class, unless it be sewing and washing. Whenever
our girls have been injured by physical exercise of
muscle or nerve, it has been, probably, because the exercise
taken has been injudicious in one of the senses above
defined. Even with regard to the stair-climbing, which
our modern houses make a necessity, the harm generally
comes from the fact that too many flights are ascended
at once, or that the lifting of the weight of the body
through the twenty, or forty, or sixty feet is too rapidly
performed. But long flights of stairs are a necessity
where land is so dear that, though a man may buy an
unlimited extension up and down, he can usually afford
to purchase little on a horizontal plane, and thus, to our
city-bred girls, at least, the necessity of climbing stairs
exists from their earliest attempts at walking, so that
stair-climbing may, by my second limitation, come under
the head of judicious exercise. It were, however, well
to inquire whether there are not different sets of muscles
called into requisition in this universal exercise by different
individuals, and whether children should not be so
educated in climbing, that they may lift the unavoidable
weight rather by straightening the knee than by making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
undue demands, as many do, on other muscles not so
well placed to bear it. It seems to me that there is a
great difference in this respect in different persons. It
were also well that architects should remember that
shallow steps may be, and, indeed, generally are, much
more fatiguing than steps of the usual height, for the
very reason that an <i>unusual</i> demand is made, a greater
number of volitions or impulses required, for a given
height. A greater width in the step, also, makes the
effort more difficult&mdash;partly for the same reason, and
partly because a greater and unusual effort has to be made
to throw the body forward at the same time that it is
lifted up.</p>

<p>To Dancing, in itself, no objection can be made. Freed
from its almost inevitable accompaniments of late hours,
thin dresses, and irregular food, it is undoubtedly beneficial.
But when we are better educated, so that we
shall appreciate the absolute necessity of a strict and
rational regimen of food, sleep, and clothing for the
individual while yet immature, this matter will be
righted, and only then. There is one additional objection
to be urged, however, against parties for young
people, which is not generally spoken of, though we all
know practically that one of the first preparations for
an entertainment of this kind consists in sending at least
almost all the chairs and sofas out of the rooms which
are to be used, and the dancing may not do as much
harm as the enforced standing. The woman who has to
stand behind the counter, or behind the bookkeeper's
desk, or at her loom in the factory, may, perhaps, accustom
herself in a measure to the daily strain; but the
girl to whom it is an irregular exercise, and who, besides,
is probably over-excited as to her nerves, cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
fail to suffer, though the blame is not, as a general rule,
laid where it belongs.</p>

<p>There is another exercise which has come into vogue
within twenty years, a game against which it is reckoned
heresy to speak slightingly&mdash;I mean Croquet&mdash;which certainly
involves an amount of standing vastly disproportioned
to the amount of exercise which it gives. This,
together with the fact that it is likely to be played during
only a few months of the year, and often on damp
ground, and for an unreasonable length of time, may,
perhaps, furnish an apology for wounding so large a
number of feelings as one must wound who has the
heart to venture a caution concerning it. It seems to be
peculiarly well described by saying that it is &ldquo;the game
which tires without exercising.&rdquo; To Skating I have
already referred for the purpose of illustration. It is
gravely to be doubted whether, in our changeable climate,
where, moreover, it can be practiced during
only a very few months in the year, it does not do more
harm than good. Horseback riding, rowing, and bowling
are very valuable, provided that they be judiciously
used.</p>

<p>But there is one exercise to which no doubt attaches,
one which can be regular, and hence judicious. This is
Walking; and the fact that so few of our girls and
women really enjoy it, that so few are capable of walking
four or five miles without fatigue, and that they
come in, after a walk of one mile, jaded and tired, instead
of invigorated, points to a grave error of omission
in their education. The walk of the little girl should
be so regular a thing, so much a part of the day's
routine, that she would as soon think of dispensing
with her morning bath as of passing a day without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
it.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Healthy children of three years old, who are educated
to walk regularly, can, as I know by actual careful observation,
walk two miles at once without fatigue, coming
in at the close, brighter and more active than when they
set out. This matter of walking is a matter which, as
well as sleep, food and clothing, belongs to education;
and if the girl does not enjoy walking&mdash;nay, if she does
not demand it with as sharp an appetite as she has for
her food and sleep, it is generally because she has not
been properly and rationally educated.</p>

<p>If it is said that it is &ldquo;not natural&rdquo; for some to like to
walk, the only proper answer to the objection would be
that the question whether a thing is natural or not is not
at all pertinent, and involves an entire misunderstanding
of education itself. The very essence of civilization, of
morality, and of religion, consists in the overruling and
directing of the merely natural. By nature, man is not
man at all. Only in so far as by force of spirit he overcomes,
rules, and directs the nature in him, can he lay
any claim to manhood. Education, physical, intellectual,
moral or religious, is in its process only this directing of
what is natural for us. Its material is the natural man;
its result is the spiritual man; its process is the rationally-directed
transition from the former to the latter. Between
the helpless infant, aimlessly stretching out its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
feeble arms, and the well-trained and fully-developed
man; between the mind of the savage who roams the
forest, and the mind of Bacon or Shakespeare; between
the brute who strikes down his wife as he would knock
over a stick of wood in his way, and the physician who
stands at his post, tenderly and wisely caring for the
fever-stricken patients in the Memphis hospitals, laying
down his life for strangers; between the man who follows
the caprice of this or that moment, as a desire for present
pleasure may suggest, and the noblest Christian who
daily sacrifices his own to the Divine will, there is but
one difference&mdash;that of Education. The natural part of
any one of us is, in any significant sense, simply the uneducated
part. If a certain course of action is once
recognized as rational, it is unnecessary to state that it is
&ldquo;not natural,&rdquo; and the formation of rational <i>habits</i> of
body, as of mind, these habits which constitute our
second and better nature, is the very work with which
education is concerned.</p>

<p>There is room, however, for misunderstanding here,
and this I must pause to guard against; I must not be
interpreted as saying that all natural feelings or actions
are to be crushed out by a cold, reasoning logic. But it
must be remembered that every virtue has its negative
representative, and that this negative phase is simply and
only the same virtue, but in an uneducated state, and not
at all another and different thing; as, for instance, license
is not different in its essence from self-control&mdash;it is only
uneducated self-control. Obstinacy is merely uneducated
firmness, and the worst forms of barbarous superstition
are but the outcome of uneducated reverence. The lawlessness
and bravado of our American children and youth,
so severely commented upon by foreigners, are simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
an index of the uneducated state of the greatest amount
of directive force that the world has ever seen. A fatal
error is committed in education when this central truth
is overlooked, as when one treats these manifestations as
in themselves wrong, instead of recognizing their value,
and bending the energies in their proper direction.
If a missionary should begin his work by destroying in
the mind of the savage all reverence for his own and
only gods, he would have sawed off the branch on which
he himself hoped to stand, and it were wise for him
to make his escape from the country as soon as possible.</p>


<h3>SEXUAL EDUCATION.</h3><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Up to the period of life at which the sexes diverge,
that is, up to the time when the boy becomes a man and
the girl a woman, the physical system pursues the even
tenor of development, broken only by the two marked
advances of the cutting of the first and second teeth.
But now, the strength of the general system is supposed,
in the counsels of the Creator, to have attained sufficient
strength and firmness to be fully capable of assuming a
new duty. In both sexes, organs up to this time quiescent,
that is, as to any functional action, take on rapidly
an independent life, assert their own character, and take
up their peculiar work. Heretofore, all the physical development
of the child has been for self alone; the
gradual growth of each organism has pointed to nothing
outside; each has been in a manner isolated. But now
we have a foreshadowing of a nobler meaning to human
life, for man is not to be alone, an isolated individual;
he attains his highest significance only in relation to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
others.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I say it is supposed that by thirteen or fourteen
years of steady <i>educated</i> growth, the system in both
sexes has acquired strength enough to assume this last
duty; and if this growth has been educated growth in
both sexes, it does do so. I am considering, however,
only the girls, and all that is said hereafter must be understood
as applying specially to them. It makes its
first trial of its newly acquired power, and, in a well-trained
organism, such as we are thankful to know are
yet found in our own country, it does do so with as little
effort, with as little outer disturbance of the general
system as is manifested when the first new tooth cuts
through the gum of the seven year old little girl. If it
is asserted that such cases are rare, I can only answer
that such is not the testimony of other women of large
acquaintance, whom I have consulted; and that even if
they were, the sufficient answer to the statement would
be that cases of girls who have been physically thoroughly
educated, are equally rare. No impression can be
given to American women which will tend more directly
towards producing the opposite result in our girls, than
one which should lead them to believe thoroughly that
this last period of development is necessarily a period of
great physical or mental disturbance. American women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
have common sense enough to know that they must submit
to the inevitable, but they have also common sense
enough to fight against, and to conquer, what is not inevitable,
provided it is not desirable; and if what I have
said above could become the conviction of every American
woman as thoroughly as it is that of some of them,
we should in thirteen more years be able to prove it by
innumerable cases. Every woman who knows it and
acts upon the knowledge in educating her daughter,
thereby becomes a benefactor to her country and her
race.</p>

<p>We all know that many a baby cuts all its first teeth
without any trouble, noticeable nervous excitement, or
derangement of any of the bodily functions. We know,
also, that large numbers are sick; that large numbers
die, showing, that where the organism is weak, it is unable
to carry on the new and sudden process without
over-action, since we have only a limited quantity of
vital force. Over-action in one part, is inevitably under-action
in another, and either is but another name for,
and not the cause of, disease.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> We know that a larger
proportion of children cut their second teeth without
any disturbance, and this result was to be expected; for
the terrible, and yet most merciful hand of death, seven
years before, had thinned the ranks by transplanting the
weakest to a clime where the burden of the body is not
a hindrance, and had left us only the strongest for the
second trial. We know also, however, that many children
do suffer from nervous irritability, and from weakness
in other directions at this time. If it is the digestive
or respiratory organs that manifest the strain, the child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
is tenderly cared for; if the over-action is in the nervous
system, we &ldquo;wonder what possesses the child,&rdquo; and she,
probably, is sent out of the room, or punished in some
other way, in word or act.</p>

<p>When the third and last especial and exceptional
work takes place, we may expect the same results, and
we find them. Up to seven years of age, however, the
little girl's life has been comparatively a healthful one,
at least as far as sleep is concerned. As far as clothing
affects freedom of motion, she has also, probably, not
suffered, though when she has walked in our chilly winter
and damp spring air, she has had interposed between
her body and the climatic influences only a defence of
one thickness of cotton, while her brother has been carefully
guarded by thickly woven woolen garments. But
from seven to fourteen, the deteriorating causes in the
average American family increase rapidly in intensity,
in fact, much faster than the increase of the growing
strength. The food remains nearly the same, though
even this is not always the case, for the times at which it
is taken often become somewhat more irregular, and its
material more varied and innutritious; her hours of sleep
are considerably curtailed, from different causes; her
clothing, while not increasing in warmth and thickness, is
drawn closer, and, in addition to this, the brain is set
definitely to work in actual study. Is it not manifest,
that while the demands upon the vital force have been
increased, the supply of material has been decreased? If
this have been the case, she arrives at the period when
the third and last demand is to be made on her growing
power, with not force enough to assume the additional
work, and in consequence she shows signs of disease.
And then, forgetting all the previous want of education,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
we either tacitly assume that God treats his children as
Pharaoh treated the Israelites in his unreasonable demands,
or, holding to our faith in him, we seize upon the
first cause that presents itself to our startled vision. Because
the education of the body has had for a long time,
in our thought, an importance secondary to the education
of the mind, we very naturally seize upon the latter as
the cause of the evil, and remove the girl from school.
One is here almost tempted to wish that the mind might
be proved only a &ldquo;mode of matter,&rdquo; if, by that means,
the body might be raised up to the level of our mental
horizon, and within the circle of our rational sympathy,
for if we knew that matter and mind were the same, the
matter of which our bodies are composed might then
secure a chance for respectful and rational attention.</p>

<p>But there are here other considerations of immense
importance which must not be overlooked, and it is to
these that any rational treatment of the subject must
turn its main attention. Besides laying the foundation
of trouble at this time, in a neglect of proper physical
education for thirteen years back, we have also taken
pains to lay it in too great an attention to mental education
for exactly the same number of years. It must not
be forgotten that the little girl, as she looks out for the
first time through her intelligence-lighted eyes, by taking
notice of anything, while she lies in her mother's arms,
looks out upon a vast and complicated world of civilization,
of which she is entirely ignorant, and that, from the
very fact that she is &ldquo;the heir of all the ages,&rdquo; she has
to make acquaintance with her inheritance. To the baby,
the light, all sounds, its cradle, the room, its own moving
fingers, its mother's face, are vast regions of unexplored
knowledge. There is absolutely nothing, however small,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
which is common or customary, and, as she grows older,
to the three year old child even, a walk down one of our
avenues, or the examination of a bureau drawer, is as exciting
as a journey in a fairy palace. In fact, the whole
world around her is merely one vast fairy palace, in which
miracles are continually occurring, quite as astonishing
and exciting as the appearance of the Genies at the rubbing
of the wonderful lamp. And her world grows
every day fuller and wider and more enchanting, just as
the hazy cloud of the milky way unfolds and reveals itself
to us under more and more powerful telescopes into star-dust,
into myriads of distinct shining points, into stars
and suns; and, under the telescopes of reasoning science,
into worlds separated by distances so great, that &ldquo;the
imagination sinks exhausted,&rdquo; and very properly. Now,
if any one will recall the sensation with which she first
looked through a powerful telescope at this sight, she
will then understand the state in which the brain of the
little girl lives, as a continual atmosphere, and she will
have no need to ask herself whether it is needful or allowable
to add much cause for activity to that brain, for,
at least, the first seven years of its life.</p>

<p>If mothers could only go to walk themselves with their
little girls more often, instead of sending their ignorant
nurses, they would comprehend this more fully.
The fact that they do not &ldquo;want to be bothered&rdquo; with
the child, only shows that they are dimly conscious of the
truth, though their action testifies that they do not appreciate
its significance. It is not necessary to speak
only of city life here, for a walk along a country road
keeps the little three year old girl in a state of continual
high excitement. Is there not the wonderful thistle-down
to be blown away, and the flight of each silken-winged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
seed to be watched with anxious eyes? Are there not
clusters of purple and white asters in unexpected places?
Are not the steep and dangerous rocky precipices by the
side of the way to be daringly scaled and slid down? Do
not the geese live in this pasture, and the sheep and the
one solitary pig in that? The raspberry vines droop
their rosy fruit into her hand, the tall, big, golden-rods
snap their stalks so unexpectedly when she bends them,
while she finds herself unable to gather the slender grasses.
Then there are such charming nooks for hiding, among
the ferns and hazel-bushes, and the bits of mica glistening
all along the road are each of a different size and shape,
and must be carefully collected. The toad startles her as
it leaps out of the road, the grasshoppers strike her face,
and wonderful people drive by in wonderful machines,
drawn by vast and wonderful animals. The amount of
knowledge which an intelligent child will accumulate
during seven weeks' stay in a quiet country town, alone
can measure the amount of brain activity which has been
carried on for that time; and yet we drive and force this
activity from her earliest years, when we ought only to
direct it. We exhibit her in her babyhood to crowds of admiring
and exciting friends, we overwhelm her with an
unreasonable number and variety of exciting toys, we tease
her to repeat her little sayings for the amusement of grown
people, and lastly, we send her to school to be still more
excited, and to have vast additional fields of knowledge of
a different kind open to her. The fact is, that no child
is ready to go to school till she has had time enough allowed
for the dazzling and exciting illumination which
pervades the atmosphere of childhood, to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">&ldquo;die away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fade into the light of common day.&rdquo;<br /></span></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
We send children to school&mdash;or rather we begin voluntarily
to teach them, too early by several years, and the
only result is that the brain is &ldquo;too early overstrained,
and in consequence of such precocious and excessive
action, the foundation for a morbid excitation of the
whole nervous system is laid in earliest childhood.&rdquo; As far
as the home-life fosters this over-activity, that is, before
the time of school life, I think it will be readily acknowledged
that this showing-off process is applied with
greater force to girls than to boys. The boy is left more
to his own devices, but the girl must be made to contribute
more to the general amusement of the family, and
she must learn &ldquo;to make herself useful.&rdquo; It is true that
to be of service to others, in a rational sense, should be
her ruling motive of action, but one may, perhaps, question
whether such early expectation, in such ways, be
not, at least, &ldquo;penny wise and pound foolish.&rdquo; To this
cause may be attributed a great part of the failure in the
health at the last special time of development.</p>

<p>As to the mental progress made, John Stuart Mill
may, as he says, have entered life &ldquo;a quarter of a century
in advance of his contemporaries,&rdquo; but was he a quarter
of a century ahead of others of his own age when he
left it? The question is at least suggestive of the
truth.</p>

<p>But, with the development of the organs which are so
indissolubly associated with the deepest feelings and with
the mental powers, there is also a corresponding mental
development. Not only does &ldquo;the blood rush more
vigorously, the muscular strength become more easily
roused into activity, but an indefinable impulse takes
possession of the whole being,&rdquo; and a great excitation
of the imagination also is perceivable. Just here, then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the educator recognizes a duty. This increased force,
which we could not prevent if we would, and would not
if we could, must be guided into rational channels&mdash;and
here I have to speak of a branch of the subject which is
not often considered. I mean the duty of the mother,
who is in this department the proper educator, to speak
earnestly, fully, and plainly to the girl of the mysterious
process of reproduction. Rosenkranz<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> says, somewhere,
that when any nation has advanced far enough in culture
to inquire whether it is fit for freedom, the question
is already answered; and in the same way, when a girl,
in her thought, has arrived at the point of asking earnest
questions on this subject, she is fit to be answered. But
just here let me call attention to the infinite importance,
in this part of education, of perfect confidence and freedom
between mother and daughter, and to the equally
important fact, that this confidence which does exist at the
beginning of life, if once lost, can never fully be restored.
If there is a shade of reserve on the part of the girl, it
will manifest itself just here and now. Instead of seeking
the information which she really desires, at its only
proper source, at that source whence she would receive it
pure, and invested with a feeling of reverence and sanctity,
of which she could never divest herself, she seeks
it elsewhere. She picks it up piece-meal in surreptitious
and clandestine ways, as if it were some horrible
mystery which must, from its very nature, be covered
up from the light of day. She talks it over with her
young companions in secrecy, and the charm of mystery
keeps her thoughts unduly brooding upon the subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>In old times, and even now, in other countries, the
danger was not, is not, so great. Foreign girls have a
much closer supervision exercised over them, and their
life in the nursery is far less nerve-stimulating than that
of American children. They do not ask questions so
early as the American girl, and when they do, they have
at hand not nearly so many sources of information. If
this all-necessary love and confidence is unbroken, and if
the mother have been so educated herself, that she recognizes
the importance of the moment, and has the requisite
knowledge, there is no danger at all. The occasion is
seized, and her womanly, &ldquo;clear, and dignified statement,
destroys all the false halo with which the youthful fancy
is so prone to surround the process of reproduction, and,
at this time, the fancy is very active with relation to
whatever pertains to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not for one moment forget that I am speaking of
physical education. The physical consequences of mistakes
on this point are decided. By the continual dwelling
of the imagination on this subject&mdash;of the imagination,
I say, for there can be no thought where there is no
clearness&mdash;the blood is diverted to these organs, and
hence, &ldquo;the brain and spinal cord, which develop so
rapidly at this period, are not led to a proper strength.
The easily-moulded material is perverted to the newly-aroused
reproductive organs,&rdquo; and the preternatural activity
thus produced is physical disease.</p>

<p>But more than this: I should be fairly accused of quitting
the physical for the moral side of education here, if
it were not that I am now upon ground, where, more
than on any other, body and soul, matter and spirit, touch
each other, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to
draw the dividing line. The inter-action of the two upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
each other here becomes so rapid and intense, that one
scarcely knows the relation of cause and effect. I repeat&mdash;more
than this: The patched and medley knowledge
of the young girl to whom her mother does not speak,
comes to her garbled and confused, the sacred seal of
modesty torn off, soiled with the touch of vulgar hands,
defaced by the coarse jests of polite society, its sanctity
forever missed. The temple has been invaded, its white
floors trodden by feet from muddy alleys, the gods
thrown down. Is not the temple as much ruined when
this profanation has been accomplished, as if the walls
had fallen? I will not be misunderstood as doubting,
for one moment, the purity of soul of American girls as
a whole; but I assert, that the result of which I have
spoken is terribly common in our large cities, and that
it is much more likely to be common in America than in
any other country, from the effect of our climate, our
free institutions, and the almost universal diffusion of
printed matter.</p>

<p>The remedy lies alone in the hands of the mother,
and, where a girl is away from her mother, in the hands
of her woman guardian, whoever she may be. When
our women are better educated, there will be less prudery
and more real modesty.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> When the minds of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
girls and women are kept busy on other things, they will
have no time for this most dangerous brooding. Most
truly does Schiller say: &ldquo;<i>In m&uuml;ssiger Weile schafft der
b&ouml;se Geist</i>,&rdquo; and he spares neither body nor soul.</p>

<p>It is always asserted that woman makes and rules
society. When our women are better educated themselves,
their righteous indignation will banish forever
from all conversation in which they have a part, the fashionable
jests on subjects which do not admit of jest, and
the <i>doubles entendres</i> whose power to excite a smile consists
in their vulgar and profane suggestions. They are as
common in companies of average women as in companies
of average men, and they evidence thoughts, and are themselves
as much coarser and lower than the outspoken utterances
of Shakespeare's ideal women&mdash;whom they assume
to criticise and condemn&mdash;as the smooth and subtle
rhymes of Swinburne and Joaquin Miller are below the
poetry of Chaucer and Spenser.</p>

<p>Closely connected with this part of my subject is that
of the reading in which girls are passively allowed
to indulge. How large a proportion of mothers and
guardians exercise anything which can be called watchful
care as to what books and papers the children shall
read; and yet the booksellers' shelves groan under
the weight of the most dissipating, weakening, and
insidious books that can possibly be imagined; and
newspapers which ought never to enter any decent
house, lie on the tables of many a family sitting-room.
Any one who will take the trouble to examine the
records of any large circulating library, will be astounded
at the immense demand which there is for these average
novels. And in our parlors and chambers to-day, myriads
of little girls are curled up in corners, poring over such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
reading&mdash;stories of complicated modern society, the very
worst kind of reading for a child&mdash;stories &ldquo;whose exciting
pages delight in painting the love of the sexes for
each other, and its sensual phases.&rdquo; And the mothers
do not know what they are reading; and the children
answer, when asked what they read, &ldquo;Oh, anything that
comes along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How find a remedy for this evil? How stem this
tide of insidious poison that is sapping the strength of
body and mind? How, but by educating their taste
till they shall not desire such trash, and shall only
be disgusted with it, if by chance it fall under their
eyes? How, but by giving their minds steady and regular
work? If the work be intermittent, it will, under
the general principles laid down in the remarks on exercise,
not only be, from that fact, injurious to the brain,
but it will afford, at the most susceptible period of life,
leisure for reveries which can lead only to evil, moral
and physical. But give our girls steady and regular
work of muscle and brain, a rational system of exercise
for both, so that the &ldquo;motor and nervous systems may
weary themselves in action, and may be desirous of rest,&rdquo;
and evil will be not only prevented, but cured, if existing.</p>

<p>Even if these trashy books, which we find everywhere,
not excepting the Sunday-school libraries, be not actually
exciting and immoral in tone and sentiment, they are so
vapid, so utterly without purpose or object, so devoid of
any healthy vigor and life, that they are simply dissipating
to the power of thought, and hence weakening to
the will. No one needs to be told how great is the influence
of the will over physical health, and any weakening
of it tends inevitably to a slackening of all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
vital forces, by which alone we preserve health, or even
life itself.</p>

<p>All such books can be kept out of a house, and their
entrance should be guarded against far more vigorously
than we oppose the entrance of noxious gases, or even
of draughts of pure air. Some of us, many of us, have
reason to be grateful that in our fathers' houses no such
books were to be found. Poets were there, novelists
were there in abundance, but of such poisonous and
weakening literature, no trace; and as we are grateful to
our parents for the care and simple regimen which preserved
our physical health for us, we thank them also
for the care which kept out of our way the mental food
which they knew to be injurious, and for which they
themselves had been too well educated to have any
taste.</p>

<p>The possession, through the instrumentality of education,
of simple and healthy appetite and taste, physical and
mental, is the most valuable gift that the father, that the
mother, can give their children, a gift in comparison
with which a legacy of millions of dollars sinks into
utter insignificance. And a tithe of the thought and
care which are expended in accumulating and investing
property on the part of the one, a tithe of the care and
thought used on dress on the part of the other, would
serve to secure it!</p>

<p>The exclusively American habit of taking young girls
to fashionable resorts for the summer should also be
alluded to here. No custom could be more injurious
than this in the influences of food, clothing and sleep,
which it almost inevitably brings; and added to these,
girls in idleness, and left to amuse themselves, are often
in such places thrown into contact with persons of both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sexes, whose conversation is the worst possible in its
effect on mind and body.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>But, according to the general principle of education,
we must not repress imagination in one direction without
furnishing it some rational food in another; for education,
as has been said, consists not in destroying but in
training the natural man, and any system which aims
at destroying any natural impulse only defeats its own
end. For this purpose, and at this period of life, it
were well to draw the imagination to &ldquo;the enjoyment
of the beautiful through an actual contemplation of it,
and for this purpose the study of painting and sculpture
is of pre-eminent value. * * * * * Through their
means the allurement which the wholly or especially the
half-undraped form has for us, becomes softened and
purified. The enjoyment of beauty itself is the enjoyment
of something divine; and it is only through a
coarse, indecent, and already infected imagination, belonging
to a general sensuality, that it degenerates into
excitement.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> &ldquo;Let our artists rather be those who are
gifted to discern the true nature of beauty and grace,
amid fair sights and sounds; and beauty, the effluence
of fair works, will meet the sense like a breeze, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>sensibly
draw the soul, even in childhood, into harmony
with the beauty of Reason.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>There is another matter which can scarcely be passed
over in silence in this discussion, but the evil effects of
which are seldom recognized. There are many men in
middle life against whose character no whisper has ever
dared to raise itself, men of culture and power, men of
strong personal &ldquo;magnetism&rdquo;&mdash;I use the term because
no other will express exactly what I mean&mdash;who often
attract the almost idolatrous admiration of young girls
and young women. They may do this at first unconsciously;
but they are pleased by it finally, and seem to
enjoy being surrounded, as it were, by a circle of young
incense-bearers, and they seem to see no harm in, to say
the least, passively permitting this excessive, sentimental,
and unnatural admiration. No harm is done? But
harm is done, and that of the most insidious character.
There is a time in the life of a majority of girls and boys
when the half-conscious and just awakening spirit is, as
it were, casting around in every direction for a some one,
they know not who;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and if at this time the young girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
comes under the influence of one of these men, she is
likely to fall into a most unnatural and morbid state;
and the man, whoever he be, that shows himself pleased
by such adoration and devotion, who does not by the
force of loyalty to the simple Right, persistently and
quietly repel, and effectually repel, all such tribute, is responsible
for much harm, and must answer for much unhappiness.
The remedy would lie in an education for these
girls which should be sound and healthful; in ample,
active employment of the thought in other directions.
The safeguard, however, lies in the mother's hands. No
mother who holds the unquestioned confidence of her
daughter need ever fear for her in this or any other
way. So long as the girl knows that she can go fearlessly
to her mother with all her thoughts and fancies,
foolish though they be, so long as she is never repelled
or shut up within herself by ridicule or want of comprehension,
so long she is as safe, wherever she may be and
into whatever companionship fallen, as if fenced about
with triple walls of steel. But let that perfect confidence
which should subsist between mother and daughter be
once lost or disturbed; let the girl once fear to think
aloud to her mother, and the charm is broken, and
dangers encompass her around. No thoughtful woman
can see a girl, thus alone, carried away by her impulsive
feeling, devoting herself to the worship of some
prominent man who dares to encourage or permit such
tribute, without longing to step between and defend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
her, as Spenser's Britomart did the innocent Amoret
from what she knows is the unseen, unfelt, and yet real
danger.</p>

<p>As to direct physical care of themselves, American
girls between fourteen and twenty-one are to be ruled
only through their own convictions on the side of prudence,
for they will not, as has been before said, blindly
obey what seem to them arbitrary rules, as the girls of
some other nations can be easily made to do. The
American mother is not so likely to say to her daughter,
&ldquo;You must not go to this party,&rdquo; as, &ldquo;Do you think
you had better go?&rdquo; If a girl, then, is made to know
that when any organ is in a congested and softened state
it is much more likely to be injured than at other times,
she will not, while this is the case, if previously properly
educated on the will side, draw her dress tightly around
her yielding form, and stand or dance at a party for
hours together; she will not skate for hours; she will
probably not ride for hours on a trotting horse; she will
not take long walks; she will not race violently upstairs,
or plunge violently down, because she has been taught
to believe that no one can with impunity array her individual
will against the laws of nature; and thus two
of the most frequent causes of trouble, which are
displacements or the bending forward of any organ, will
be avoided. If she persists in trying experiments, she
will not be obliged to experiment for a very long time
in order to satisfy herself that the wisdom of ancient
tradition is of more value than her individual opinion;
but the girl who has been properly educated for fourteen
years has already made this discovery. However, if,
after all advice, any one should persist in so unreasonable
a course, she is, when fully grown, a rational and respon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>sible
being, and, as such, is answerable alone to herself
and to her Creator for the marring of his workmanship.
What folly, what worse than folly, should we think it
in the managers of a steamship to intrust the care of the
machinery to an engineer who knew nothing of its construction,
or of the way in which the parts act upon one
another; and yet, the mother who leaves her daughter
in ignorance, and then does not carefully guard her herself,
is guilty of worse than this; and when the evil is
done, the advice of the wisest physician can only be the
enjoinment of the very sanitary rules which she herself
should have long before enforced; for &ldquo;the true method
of Sexual Education must remain that which has been
always hitherto spoken of, that of correct living.&rdquo;</p>

as bookkeepers, I would call attention to the fact that it
presents practically no obstacle whatever to their employment. For
instance, one of the largest wholesale and retail firms in St. Louis
has for years employed a woman bookkeeper, and she has never
been expected to stand. Low instead of high desks are in their
counting-room, and low chairs are also found there. The books,
bills, etc., are convenient to her hand, and no difficulty whatever is
experienced. It may, perhaps, be a pertinent question to ask, in
what consists the advantage of a high stool and a high desk over
a low chair and a low desk, and whether it takes any more time to
rise from a chair, than to swing down from a stool.</p></div>

unconstrained they are with regard to nature. True modesty is as
far removed from coarseness as from prudery. Coarseness takes a
delight in making the relation of the sexes the subject of ambiguous,
witty, shameless talking and jesting, and it is just as blamable
as prudery, which externally affects an innocence no longer existing
therein. Here is, consequently, the point in which physical education
must pass over into moral education, and where the purity of
the heart must hallow the body.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>MENTAL EDUCATION,</h2>
<h3>or,<br />
THE CULTURE OF THE INTELLECT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Now, as refusal to satisfy the cravings of the digestive faculty
is productive of suffering, so is the refusal to satisfy the craving of
any other faculty productive of suffering, to an extent proportioned
to the importance of that faculty. But, as God wills man's happiness,
that line of conduct which produces unhappiness is contrary
to his will.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Francis Bacon.</span></p></div>

<p>If one is to educate the body, she would be presumptuous
in the extreme if she made the attempt without
first understanding in some measure its anatomy and
physiology. With as much reason, in approaching the
subject of mental education&mdash;that one third of education
which with too many persons stands for the whole&mdash;we
must pause a moment for a few reflections on the nature
of mind and the necessary results thereof, &ldquo;<i>Mind is
essentially self-activity</i>.&rdquo; In this, as we have been
taught, lies its essential difference from mere matter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
whose most essential property is inertia&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, absolute
inability to move itself or to stop itself.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, mind acts at all, it must act from
within, and no amount of information given will be of
the slightest concern to it, unless by its own activity the
mind reach forth, draw it in, and assimilate it to itself.
This voluntary activity, directed towards any subject, is
Attention, and so great is the power of mind when in
this state, that it dissolves and draws in all food, no matter
how abstruse, that may present itself. Thus the
problem of mental education, which had seemed so complex,
resolves itself very simply. We have first to educate
the attention of the child, so that she shall be able
to use it at will, and to turn it towards any object desired;
and secondly, we simply have to present to the
aroused attention the knowledge which the past centuries
have created and accumulated, and to present this in such
quantity and in such order as the experience of the
same centuries has decided to be best for its normal
growth.</p>

<p>To begin with, then, we must educate the child from
the first into a habit of controlling and directing her
naturally drifting and capricious attention by the will.
The power of the child is very limited in this respect.
Her eyes, the index of her attention, wander easily from
one external object to another, and consequently our
work must be very gradual, for, if we attempt to
hold the attention one moment longer than the mind
has strength for, the tense bow snaps, and the over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>strained
activity lapses into inanity. We must ask her
attention for very short intervals at first, and during
many years; for every time that we attempt to convey
information for so long that the attention gives way,
we have weakened, and not strengthened the power.
Exercise, to be judicious, we must remember, must, in
mind as well as body, be regular, and increase steadily in
its demand. The object of the first teaching should,
therefore, be the steady and methodical cultivation of
the faculty of attention, and not the acquisition of knowledge.
Our first work must be to give such judicious
exercise that the mind shall acquire a habit of exercise
and an appetite for it, and not to spoil at the outset the
mental digestion. A healthy appetite being once created,
we have then only to spread the table and place the
courses one after another, at proper intervals, and within
convenient reach, in regular order, and the work is done.</p>

<p>But the child, as she grows from child to woman, must
pass through three stages, showing three different directions
which are successively taken by the intelligent activity.
First, she is occupied in perceiving objects. She
then passes into the years dominated by the imagination,
and she should emerge from this into the dominion of
rational, logical thought, but, through the fault of a defective
education, she often never passes beyond the second
stage. Thus dwarfed and crippled she remains during
her whole life, physically a woman, mentally a child.
Better days are, however, dawning, though the sun be
but one hour high.</p>

<p>Again, serious errors are made in education, from the
want of a proper appreciation of the time at which the girl
passes inevitably from one to the other of these stages.
When, for example, authors of text-books on Natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Science, History and Reading, designed for pupils of fifteen
and sixteen years of age, cover more space with illustrations
than with text, we recognize the fact that they
forget that at that age, the first or intuitional stage is past;
and when publishers endeavor to recommend their books
to teachers, by sending them specimens of the pictures in
the books, instead of specimens of the explanations and
statements, the teachers know that they are supposed to
be equally admirers of fine wood-cuts.</p>

<p>In the first, or intuitional stage, when the child is
chiefly employed with perceptions, there is little to be
done but to train the eye, the ear, the hand and the
voice, and to teach the correct use of distinctly spoken
language.</p>

<p>It is clearly impossible to investigate the subject of
mental education in detail in the present essay; I must
content myself with a few suggestions and statements.</p>

<p>First, is it not evident that it is all-important what
kind of training the little girl receives in the first years
of her school life, while she is yet in the intuitional or
perceptive stage? A failure to properly train her attention
here, and the whole of her after-work is invalidated.
Her school work becomes, in its progress, tiresome, and
hence disagreeable, from the constant necessity of repetition,
a necessity arising from the want of a trained
power of attention. She is found fault with for restlessness
and want of interest, as if that were her fault, and
not her misfortune; and, at the end, her knowledge is at
best but &ldquo;a thing of shreds and patches,&rdquo; till, when all
is done and the result exhibited, we ask, with a sigh,
&ldquo;whether it be really worth while to go through so much
to gain so little.&rdquo; And yet, what care do guardians take
to secure the best advantages for their daughters at fifteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and seventeen, and of how little importance do they consider
it, under what kind of teaching they place them between
eight and fifteen! The error is all the same in the
intellectual as in the physical education of our girls. We
are continually carefully locking the stable-door after the
horse is stolen; we are continually allowing things to go
wrong, and then making superhuman efforts to right them,
not remembering that it is far easier to keep out of trouble
than to get out of it. If a girl must be trusted to incompetent,
or, at the best, doubtful, teachers during half
her school life, let that half be the last, and not the first,
and incompetency will be shorn of half its power to injure.
Not only directly in the interest of the girls, but
in the interest of my own profession&mdash;though the two
are one&mdash;I ask this, for in that case, our profession would
soon be elevated in its general tone by the elimination
from it of those who ought never to have entered it.</p>

<p>Passing from the intuitional epoch to the age when
the imagination and emotion become the ruling powers,
we next arrive at the time at which it becomes necessary
for parents to see to it that plenty of good reading is provided
for the eager child. It makes not so much difference
what kind of books she reads, but they should always
be the very best of their kind, for this is the time in
which the formation of a correct taste becomes, perhaps,
the most important duty of the educator. To poetry,
either in verse or not, each child inclines naturally, as did
the race in its childhood, and the stories of the Old Testament
and Homer are never wearisome. Generally,
&ldquo;the proper classical works for youth are those which
nations have produced in the earliest stages of their culture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now is the season for fairy stories, and the Ger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>mans,
who, of all nations best understand the needs of
children, have them ready furnished to our hand. I do
not mean the absurd, aimless, and meaningless fairy tales
with which modern writers endeavor to supplant the
fairy classics, and which, for the most part, the instinct of
a child at once condemns. I doubt very seriously whether
it is possible at the present time, and in America, to
write a fairy story which shall have the true ring in it,
any more than it would be possible for any one to write
a genuine epic poem. The circumstances favorable to
the production of both have passed away with modern
times, but the productions are left us, a perpetual legacy
of delight and charm to every little girl.</p>

<p>We are too apt to forget that the child must live through
certain stages of thought and feeling in order to arrive at
maturity. And perhaps Americans are more liable to
this error than any other nation. We might as well expect
the full bloom of the rose to burst from the root
without the intervention of stem and bud, and the slow
passing of the years. It is right that the children should
devour fairy stories, and she, who, at this period of life,
fails to read the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, must miss forever a
most valuable part of her mental education: for this
period, once past, never returns. Don Quixote and Gulliver's
Travels may be also mentioned here. It is true
that they were not written for children, but so true and
genuine are they, that the child enjoys them thoroughly,
while the most mature find them a profitable study. This
peculiarity of adaptation to all ages belongs to all the
genuine myths of any nation, its best modern master
being Hans Christian Andersen. It is the royal sign and
seal of authority in stories. Ballad poetry belongs too to
the beginning of this stage. Scott comes in later, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Tennyson does not belong in it at all. These examples
will be sufficient to express my meaning.</p>

<p>It would be a very valuable aid in the education of
our girls at this time, if some one who is capable would,
out of her riches of wide reading, give us a list, with
publishers' names, of these books of all time which ought
to be read by every child; a list to which any mother,
anxious for the right guidance of her little girl's taste,
and yet ignorant of the best means, might refer with
perfect confidence.</p>

<p>We must not, as has been well said, deprive books for
children of the &ldquo;shadow-side&rdquo; of life, because in that case
they become artificial and untrue, and the child rejects
them. &ldquo;For the very reason that in the stories of the
Old Testament we find envy, vanity, evil desire, ingratitude,
craftiness and deceit among the fathers of the Jewish
race, and the leaders of God's chosen people, have
they so great an educational value,&rdquo; and when we have
purged the narrations of all these characteristics, and present
to the child an expurgated edition, we find that they
no longer charm her. Nothing disgusts a child sooner
than <i>childishness</i> in stories written for her, and it is because
very few people can rightly draw the line between
what is childish and what is child-like, that we find so
few who are able to write stories which are really adapted
to children, and that so many who address Sunday-schools
fail to interest. Every woman who has proved her power
in this direction may be said, in the dearth of valuable
books for children, to owe a duty to her country by giving
them more. As the child grows towards womanhood,
tragedy will take the place of the epic poem and ballad,
and will lead, it may be unconsciously, to a deepening of
the sense of responsibility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The question what the girl shall read belongs not at
all to herself, but to those who know the world better
than she, and who, through the fact that they are educated
while she is not, know what and when to select.
Hence the immense importance, not only to the girl herself,
but to the whole country, of the thorough intellectual
education of our girls.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>But enough has been said on the subject of reading,
and of the distinctions which should be made. I may
add, however, that the line before alluded to is to be
drawn in novels. As, for instance, the girl is ready
for Dickens before she ought to read Thackeray, as Dickens
dwells more in the region of the simple emotions,
while Thackeray has moved on into the sphere of emotion
which is conscious of itself, or of the reflecting and critical
understanding.</p>

<p>Supposing now that the girl has passed beyond the
psychical stage of the Imagination into the stage of Logical
Thought, it is immensely important that in this stage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
also she should not miss a systematic education. If this
should be the case, she is defrauded of the key which
alone can render intelligible the scattered work of the
previous epoch. The work of education in the first, or
intuitional epoch is general; in the second, or imaginative,
special; and in the third, or logical, returns again to
the general; and thus only can it constitute a whole. In
the first, the child picks up facts and general principles
from them; in the second, the little girl pursues, each for
itself, different branches of study; in the third, she should
be led to see the connection and interdependence of these
branches, to weave together the loose ends. If she is not
so led, if her education stops with the work of the second
stage&mdash;the only work which it is possible to do in the
second stage, on account of the laws of the development
of the intellectual power&mdash;her education remains forever
unfinished, a garment not firm enough to endure the
stress of time, not fine enough to bear a moment's keen
scrutiny, and only strong enough to fetter and trip feet
that endeavor to make any real after-progress by its aid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet this is what we are in the majority of cases
doing for, or rather against, our intelligent and energetic
American girls. Does it ever occur to us to ask what
becomes of this energy, deprived thus of its natural outlet?
We have only to turn to the records of our insane
asylums or to the note-books of the physician and we are
partially answered. This is more true than is generally
supposed. If these girls had had real work for which they
were responsible, and felt themselves able rationally to
utilize the power of which they were blindly conscious,
they would not be found to-day in the wards of asylums,
or condemned to the luxurious couches on which they
spend their &ldquo;inglorious days.&rdquo; Or, thirdly, we may find
another and quite different development of this perverted
but not destroyed energy,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> this closing of the top of
the chimneys. Many a woman is antagonistic, is combative,
because she is forced into such a position, not because
she herself desires it. The smoke starts for the
top of the chimney, as it should; but, baffled, it frets itself
in eddying whirls against the bricks, till, driven by
the necessity of an outlet somewhere, not understanding
what the trouble is, but only dimly realizing that there
is trouble, it rushes back, choking in its passage the fire,
and revenging itself on the author of the repression.</p>

<p>Men and women are wonderfully alike after all. The
same motives move them, the same incitements spur to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
honorable effort, and if a girl is assured that, being half-educated,
half-educated she must remain, she will not,
unless driven by the internal fire of irrepressible genius,
try very earnestly to fit herself for the higher plane
which she can never reach.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>By all means it were far better, if effort for broader
work be of no avail, to cease to think of it, and to make
one's self as comfortable as possible. And yet, how about
the comfort in the coming years, when her girls, who,
thanks to the inevitable march of Truth, will have a better
chance than she, and her boys, to whom the last stage
of education is to be had for the asking, come to her in
vain for sympathy and appreciation, to say nothing of
the husband, from all understanding of whose rational
thought she finds herself barred out?<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Babies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
half-educated children are very pretty to play with, interesting
to watch, and delightful to care for, but when
they are married and have children, for they can never
be said, in any true sense, to be wives or mothers, they
appear in a somewhat different aspect. I have sometimes,
out of sheer pity, wished that there were some
State asylum for such children, when they are left, as the
chances of life and death so often leave them, unprotected
in the world, with dependent children clinging to
their useless hands. I have never seen a sadder sight
than such a woman, her physical system in perfect order
and superbly developed, looking stunned and helpless
into the world, unable to do anything for herself or her
children, and dependent upon the charity of her dead
husband's friends&mdash;and perhaps the wise thought and tender
care of a faithful servant, whose practical education
was complete in the stern school of necessity&mdash;for food,
clothing, and shelter. They have been only half-educated,
and it seems as if the authority which has refused in the
past to provide them with the power for their own maintenance,
ought to recognize their right to be supported;
as much as it does recognize the duty of supporting others,
for whose education it has failed properly to care in their
youth, in jails, penitentiaries, and prisons.</p>

<p>As to the effect of the want of education and culture
upon what are known as the most characteristic womanly
qualities, whether physical or mental, no better illustra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tion
can be furnished than that of the women among the
Arkansas refugees, who during the war came crowding
for protection into Missouri. They had not dwelt in a
frigid and contracting climate; they had not been physically
overworked, and they had not been co-educated, for
they had not been educated at all, either physically, intellectually,
or morally. Should we not have expected
to find in these children of nature, these women who had
spent their lives in idleness, undisturbed by any brain-work,
at least, finely developed forms? But what did
we find in the quarters assigned them? Without a single
exception, they were tall, thin, and angular in face
and form, while the masculine loudness, harshness, and
depth of their voices, and the masculine expression of
features and movement, made us involuntarily recoil from
them as if they were something monstrous, in being neither
man nor woman. The animal nature, informed only in a
small degree by the spiritual, inevitably descends through
lower forms, and when we find it deprived entirely of spiritual
guidance, we find a something lower than the dog that
is grateful for our kindness, or the horse that whinnies as
he hears our step on the gravel-walk; for we find the
idiot.</p>

<p>But meantime, while the child is passing through all
these stages of mental development, as ordained by the
Creator, the definite school-work is intrusted to the hands
of professional teachers. American parents throw this responsibility
entirely off from their own shoulders when
they send their girls to school, with somewhat the same feeling
of relief as that with which they lead their family physician
to the bedside of the little girl, for whose indisposition
they have, before summoning him, anxiously endeavored
to care. There is only one difference: in the case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the physician, they relate to him fully all the symptoms
and previous treatment; they remain by the bedside after
he has gone, in the capacity of nurses, and they see
to it that his prescriptions are obtained and administered,
and his suggestions in every respect exactly
followed, while, in the case of the teacher, they send the
child, leaving her to make her own discoveries as to previous
symptoms and treatment, and they do not inquire
into the directions given, the nature of the work prescribed,
or the effect. Having thus, as they think, placed
the whole matter in the hands of the teacher, they are
often surprised and annoyed at the result. I am taking
it for granted here that the teacher is qualified for her
part of the work, as to method; and, if not working under
a course of study laid out for her, as in the public schools,
is herself able to arrange and plan. This is the most favorable
aspect of the subject. But there is indisputably
another side. If mothers would only work with the
teachers, so that the home influences brought to bear on the
girls in matters already discussed, especially in the direction
of the reading of their daughters, should be healthful
and strong, the teachers would be saved much time and
energy, which could be far more usefully applied for the
benefit of the child. I speak from the midst of a profession
which often suffers in reputation, nay, even in actual
character, from this very cause.</p>

<p>To go in detail through the part of intellectual education
which belongs especially to the teacher, is impossible
here, nor would such a discussion be in place in
these pages. It has its place properly only in professional
literature, just as the details of the treatment of a
case placed under medical care, whether preventive or
curative, belong only in the pages of a medical journal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
A few suggestions only will be added in this department.</p>

<p>It is evident to the most superficial observer that a
vast amount of time is spent over such studies as grammar,
geography and history in our schools, with but
little perceivable result. This is due in great measure to
the fact that the manufacture of text-books has become
in America a profitable business in a money point of
view, and that, consequently, what text-books shall be
used in our schools, both public and private, is decided
more by the publishers than by the educators. Hence
the graded series of School Geographies, for instance,
through some five or six of which the pupil is obliged to
wade, one after another, to find in each, only the same
matter in sentences of a somewhat greater length. Hence,
to go one step farther, the stupefying of so many minds
in our schools. Nothing is more deadening to all mental
activity than unmeaning repetitions, a fact easily verified
by any one who, wakeful through mental disturbance
at night, will take the trouble to repeat and re-repeat
any meaningless thing. It is the lounging, deadening
brain-work of which we have too much, not the active,
vivifying brain-work of which we have too little, that
does injure the system. The whole healthy tone of the
mind is destroyed, and evils, mental and physical, follow
in rapid succession.</p>

<p>From the process of text-book manufacturing also
spring the endless number of compendiums and abstracts
with which our schools are deluged, mental power
diluted, and the pockets of the parents unnecessarily
taxed for the support of large publishing houses, not for
the education of their children.</p>

<p>Another cause of this stupefying process is the rigid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
system by which most large schools are conducted,
where promotions, from one class to another, can take
place, say, once a year, the pupil who, on examination,
falls short of the required per cent of correct answers,
being forced to review the work of the entire previous
year before going on. More elasticity, more fluidity, as
it were, is sadly needed in our system of public school
education before this evil will be to any great extent
modified.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It would be a waste of time to say that one ought not
to be overworked, were it not that some persons always
seem to imply that any intellectual work is overwork.
It would seem equally superfluous to say that for intellectual
health there ought not to be any surplus energy,
for the latter statement seems as axiomatic as the former.</p>

<p>The problem with which educators are chiefly concerned
is that of fully employing the energies without
overtasking them. If the dividing line between <i>enough</i>
and <i>too much</i> could be determined as exactly as the
Mississippi River marks the series of lowest points where
the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains meets the
western slope of the Alleghenies, our work as teachers were
easy indeed. Teaching, however, is not the only profession
where such unsolved problems exist, for individual
cases, and we teachers are thus but a part of a noble army
of professional workers, so we take heart of grace, and are
not ashamed.</p>

<p>But the fact remains to be considered that the work of
school education is, as the result of unavoidable destiny,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in America, passing very rapidly into the hands of women.
We may deplore this, but we cannot prevent it. The
last census showed that the number of women teachers
in the United States stands already to that of the men
as 123,980 to 78,709, and the ratio is daily increasing.
There is no other country in the world, then, where it is
so all important that the girls should receive a complete
education. In one view, this tendency of the times is
of great value. The years spent in teaching are often
the most valuable training for the work of the mother.
No other employment calls for a greater exercise, and
hence, a greater development, of the directive power, and
of the knowledge of human nature which will enable her
well and wisely to direct her children, successfully to
grapple with the &ldquo;servant problem,&rdquo; and to sweep a large
circle of details within the compass of generalized rules.
She has learned what industry means, not, as was said by
a Christian writer of the thirteenth century, only &ldquo;to
pray to God, to love man, to knit and to sew.&rdquo; She
has not &ldquo;everlastingly something in her hand, though
no one profits by her labor, and she is reduced to look
for her sole reward in civil speeches made for useless gifts,
or insincere praise of household ornaments that are in
everybody's way,&rdquo; covers, and covers for covers, and
covers for covers of covers.</p>

<p>Many women &ldquo;are busy, very busy; they have hardly
time to do this thing, because they really wish, or ought
to do that, but with all their driving, their energy is entirely
dissipated, and nothing comes from their countless
labors,&rdquo; and I ask, in the words of a Russian woman. &ldquo;Is
it not a great loss to the economy of society when such
an amount of strength is wasted and leaves behind it no
good work!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But many persons continually pursue self-contradictory
ends, simply for the reason that their education has been
so narrow and limited that they are not able to see these
ends as self-contradictory.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are other disabilities than the physical
for the duty of a mother. &ldquo;The want of self-control
that comes of an objectless life, the uninquiring habit
of frivolous employment, disable her from fulfilling this
duty, and to remain a child does not give the ability to
educate children.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The power of independent thinking,
without which there can be no judgment, and which
alone frees the soul, the real mother must have, and our
girls should be most carefully educated into it.</p>

<p>Which course, then, will be best to fit the average
child for her future work in the active world, a course of
private lessons, or the life of the school, which is in itself
a miniature world, where she learns to measure her own
acquirements and character by those of others, and is
educated into the knowledge that individual caprice
cannot be allowed as a rule of conduct? And is there
any country in the world whose citizens need to learn a
respect for law more than in America?</p>

<p>As to the branches which girls have the ability successfully
to pursue, the question is no longer an open one.
The experiments at Oberlin, Antioch, the Northwestern
University, Michigan University, Vassar and many other
institutions, not to go out of our own country, are sufficiently
positive and conclusive to convince the most
incredulous.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> If the question be as to the branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
which she ought to pursue, that is also to some extent
settled. The courses of study which are laid down for
students in European and American universities, represent
simply the condensed judgment of centuries of
experience and induction as to the means by which the
human intellect may be most surely strengthened and
developed. They are the results of long generalization,
and are founded deep on a knowledge of the human
mind. Shall we venture to depart from the old ways,
and to decry the customs handed down to us from the
ages gone by? Do we not know that the wisdom of
twenty centuries, as to the best means for developing
the human mind, is greater than the knowledge of one?
Since we are &ldquo;heirs of all the ages,&rdquo; why throw away
our inheritance?</p>

<p>In one word, our girls should be so educated intellectually
that there will no longer be any internal barriers
to their progress, and when this is done they will find
that the external barriers, against which they fret themselves,
have disappeared. When Britomart had fairly
conquered and bound with his own chains the enchanter
within the castle, she found, as she passed out, that the
castle walls, the iron doors and the fire which had
barred her entrance had no longer any existence. We
can yet afford to learn lessons of wisdom from the
prophetic &ldquo;woman's poet&rdquo; of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Whether our school girls and college girls will be injured
physically, mentally or morally, by granting to the boy
and man students, in our high schools and universities, the
advantage of fellow-workers of the other sex, is a question
which, though practically settled to a large extent by
experience, ought not perhaps to be passed over here in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
entire silence. One very curious feature of this question
with regard to the education of our girls seems to be
this: those who are most urgent that the question should
be decided by facts do not bring them forward, but base
their position on general principles assumed, and on
theory. As has been well said by President White, of
Cornell, to seek for information on the real results, so
far, of the experiment in our colleges from the authorities
of colleges that have never tried it, would be to commit the
same absurdity as &ldquo;if the Japanese authorities, aroused
to the necessities of railroads and telegraphs, had corresponded
with eminent Chinese philosophers regarding
the ethics of the subject, instead of sending persons to
observe the working of railroads and telegraphs where
they were already in use.&rdquo; Where inquiries were made
of universities which had never tried the experiment,
&ldquo;the majority of responses were overwhelmingly against
the admission of women. It was declared to be 'contrary
to nature,' 'likely to produce confusion,' 'dangerous,'
'at variance with the ordinances of God;' in short,
every argument that a mandarin would be sure to evolve
from his interior consciousness against a railroad or a
telegraph which he had never seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am not forgetful that the high ground of philosophy
is the only proper one from which to settle the question of
the sphere of any human being, and what education will
fit her for it; but after this has been done, if special objections
are raised against the possibility or advisability,
in a utilitarian or physiological point of view, such special
assertions, in default, from their very nature, of any
other possible demonstration, must be proved or disproved
by experience&mdash;and yet these material facts are
not allowed in evidence by those who theoretically insist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
most vigorously upon facts.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The opponents of higher
education for women, which practically is the same thing
as co-education, have within a few years shifted their
ground. At first it was asserted that woman was not
equal, mentally, to the thorough mastering of the higher
branches of study. Having been driven from that position
by the indisputable evidence of percentages on
written examinations, they have taken up their new position
with the assertion that women are not able
physically to pursue a thorough and complete course of
study&mdash;for, I repeat again, that for the masses, co-education
and higher education for women are practically one
and the same thing. In this position of the question,
we have only two things for which to be profoundly
thankful: The first is that we, as living women, are asserted
by no one to be composed of more than two parts&mdash;spirit
and body. The second is, that we have in our own
hands, at last, the means of finally disposing of this question,
by disproving the second assertion.</p>

<p>To us as women, as wives, as mothers, as older sisters,
as friends, as teachers, as college girls, as school girls,
and to us alone, the settlement of the question has at
last been fairly handed over. We have only, in all
these relations, to learn the laws of physical health, and
to obey them, and the whole matter will be set forever
at rest. We have only to see to it, day and night, that
our girls are educated into proper ways of living as
regards food, clothing, sleep and exercise, till we have
created for them a second nature of fixed, correct physi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>cal
habits&mdash;and we alone can do this&mdash;and the end is at
hand. We have at last the right to settle our own
questions conceded to us. The responsibility of the decision,
whether our girls are to have what we demand
for them&mdash;nay, what they themselves are eagerly and
persistently demanding, is decided, by the new position,
to belong to us, and to us alone. Responsibility means
duty. Are we ready to accept the one, and to perform
the other?</p>

seem to attest.
</p><p>
&ldquo;It must be confessed, we fear, that wives and mothers are responsible
for no little of our too general disinclination for that steady,
persevering pursuit of high intellectual aims, of which Agassiz was
such a bright example. They are naturally ambitious of the outward
signs of social position, and also, on account of those they love,
eager for the solid advantages to be obtained by money. They are
not content if they cannot be dressed as finely and 'receive' as elegantly
as their friends do; and, also, they fret if their children do
not have such advantages of education and association as will secure
for them an enviable future. And thus, husbands and fathers are
driven, not only to ceaseless labor&mdash;that they would bear willingly&mdash;but
to the abandonment of their best-loved pursuits, and their highest,
most cherished purposes. Thus, money-productiveness comes to be
the test of the value of all intellectual labor, even with men who
would gladly devote their lives to science or to literature, and perhaps
be willing, for themselves, even to be poor in a society in which
poverty is almost a reproach. Thus it is that high aspirations are
checked, and that strong resolves are broken. And thus it will be,
until we have advanced to such a point of civilization and culture
that we shall award that something which is only expressed by the
word 'consideration' to other eminence than that which is attained
in politics or in trade.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I venture the question with extreme diffidence, but would not this
broader education of future wives and mothers save perhaps so
much new legislation on the subject of divorce as is now in progress
in those parts of the country most characteristically American?</p></div>

what if she has traversed every inch of these intellectual regions

reverence for her, some conception of what he felt that he owed

<div style="margin-left: 12em;"><ol><li>Civilized,</li>

<p>If educated into a civilized being, she learns to subject
her own natural and unregulated&mdash;her savage will, we
might say&mdash;to the customs and habits of civilized society.
If educated into a moral being, she learns to subject her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
will, not to the idea of what is agreeable or useful, but
to the idea of what is simply right. If educated into a
religious being, she learns to submit her will to the
Divine Will, and in her relation to God, she first becomes
freed from the bonds of all finite and transitory
things, and attains to the region where perfect obedience
and perfect freedom coincide.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A woman who is virtuous,
so to speak, with regard to the first, might be characterized
as polite; she who is virtuous in regard to the
second, as conscientious; and she who is virtuous in
regard to the third, as humble. She who is all these
may be said to have been thoroughly educated as to her
Will. The culture of the Will may be, then,</p>

<div style="margin-left: 12em;"><ol><li>Social,</li>
<li>Moral,</li>
<li>Religious.</li></ol></div>

<p>In this realm, as in that of the intellect, the process
of education consists in developing a spiritual being out
of a natural being. It is the clothing, or rather, the informing
of the natural with the spiritual. The part of
education which relates to the social life is almost entirely
given to the parents; and generally, from the
great demands which business makes on the father, it
falls almost wholly into the hands of the mother. It is
she who must train the little girl into habits of neatness,
of obedience, of order, of regularity, of punctuality&mdash;small
virtues, but the foundation stones of a moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
character, and into habits of unselfishness and of politeness.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Social Culture.</i>&mdash;Neatness in person, as in dress, is not
natural to the woman of a savage tribe, neither is it a
characteristic of hermits. It is the product of civilized
society. It is a recognition, in some sense, of the equality
of others to one's self, a bending of the undisciplined will
to the pleasure and satisfaction of others. Like all other
habits, it becomes, in time, agreeable to the person who
practises it, but the first training into it, is a painful
struggle.</p>

<p>Do we not all remember that in the picture painted
by the melancholy Jacques of the shadow side of human
existence, the &ldquo;<i>shining</i> morning face&rdquo; of the child was
not forgotten as one of the shadow tints of that stage of
life?</p>

<p>The education into habits of neatness is almost entirely
in the hands of the mother or of her deputies. She herself
then must be thoroughly educated into it, and it
were well that she remembered and taught her daughters
to remember, that real neatness includes the unseen
as well as the seen. Neatness has a moral significance
not to be despised, for though it is true that the dress is
an index of the character, and that external neatness
habitually covering untidy underclothing, is only typical
of some moral unsoundness, it is equally true that there
is an influence in the other direction, from the external,
inwards. The habit of neatness furnishes soil in which
the tree of self-respect may begin its growth. Do we
not all know that a child behaves better in clean clothes
than in soiled ones? And has there not been a perceptible
elevation in the real character of the city police since
they were dressed in neat uniforms? I know that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
fact that they are in <i>uniform</i> touches another point,
and yet it is not all. If instead of setting the beggar on
horseback, we clothe him in clean and neat garments, we
all know that we have given him an impulse in the
direction of the good.</p>

<p>Obedience is perhaps the next habit to be spoken of.
Unquestioning obedience we must demand from the child
for her own safety. It may often be a question of life
and death whether the little girl runs when she is called,
or throws away something which she has in her hand,
instead of putting it into her mouth. But has not this
habit of obedience a higher office than this? It is the
first yielding of the untrained will to rightful authority,
and as such, has an immense significance. The mother
who cannot train her daughters and sons to obedience
were better childless, for she is but giving to her country
elements of weakness, not elements of strength. She is
furnishing future inmates for jails, penitentiaries, and
prisons, and putting arms into the hands of the enemies
of law and order. And yet, how can a woman who has
no clear ideas herself of what should be demanded and
enforced, and hardly a sufficient command of language to
express directions clearly, who was never taught herself
to obey, and who has no definite idea of what end she
really wishes to attain, educate her children into obedience?
A sense of exact justice, a persistent attention,
and a consistent thought are necessary. Has the education
which we have been giving our girls tended to develop
these? Are they not &ldquo;developed only by mental work
in those very directions which have scarcely heretofore
formed a part of the education of our girls?&rdquo; Does not
the welfare of the country imperatively demand that we
give those who are to be the only educators of the chil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>dren
in their first and decisive years, a thorough, slow, a
well-founded and finished education?</p>

<p>Order, in any of its manifestations, is not natural to
the race. But the very nature of civilization forces it
upon us. We may yield our will at first to its demands,
or we may oppose, but it will not take a very long time
in the latter case for the demands of social life to give us
so great an amount of annoyance, that the pain of the
inconvenience incurred will far outweigh the pleasure of
lawlessness in this respect. Here, also, the mother is
supreme, though the teacher should come to her aid very
effectually when the school-days begin, and here I touch
a subject which demands a little more attention than has
hitherto been paid to it, for too much cannot be said of
the great significance of rules as educators in girls'
schools. It is allowed in very large schools, and where
boys and girls are brought together, that there must be
strict rules, because large masses cannot be successfully
managed without; but it is generally taken for granted
in a girls' school, and where the numbers are small, that
very little or no discipline is required or even desirable.
This view follows logically enough if one assumes that
the object of discipline is the present good of the
school as a whole. But if we assume that its prime object
is the future benefit of the pupils, individually, it
will follow that the size of the school is not an element
which should enter into the question at all, and this is
the basis which I assert to be the only true one.</p>

<p>I do not deny that there may be too many rules.
One may endeavor to hedge pupils around with arbitrary
prohibitions, but any attempt at this, like any other unreasonable
action, will soon result in its opposite, so that
the two extremes are ultimately the same in effect. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
persons speak and act as if they believed rules to be in
themselves only a necessary evil, of which the less we
have the better, and an entire absence of which would
be the desirable state. Rousseau might be said to be the
leader of this class, educationally speaking, for this is
pre-eminently the doctrine which he teaches, though
I fancy that those who object most to rules are not
often aware that they are arraying themselves under his
banner.</p>

<p>That school-work should go on in regular routine, that
a regular order should be established, and that no slight
cause should be suffered to break this, that there should
be some well-defined and regular order in which pupils
should come to and go from their hourly duties&mdash;the importance
of these things to quiet and economy of time
is as nothing, compared to the results of regulations like
these on the intellectual and moral character. The daily
and hourly habit in external observances repeats itself in
habits of thought and study. Unconsciously, facts are
learned, and thoughts take on regular habits, and the
impress made by the silent work of years is ineffaceable.
It will show itself, in years to come, if we refer only to so-called
&ldquo;practical&rdquo; things&mdash;and this is what our condemners
of rules are seeking for,&mdash;in well-ordered homes,
where each duty has its appointed time, and where the
necessary labor goes on so regularly that it is hardly noticeable,
except in an absence of all confusion and a permanent
sense of quiet;&mdash;homes where, because of this
regularity, time will remain for higher culture, and the
whole family will be elevated thereby.</p>

<p>Closely connected with this matter of regularity is that
of Punctuality, which should be no less trained at school
into a habit, and the effect of which, on the moral char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>acter,
is no less important. As far as school goes, punctuality
is necessary in order that work be thoroughly
done, and that time be saved. But it is not for this reason
so much as for the far-reaching influences on the whole
character, that the little girl should be made to feel it a
matter of importance that she is in her seat when the
bell strikes, and that she is ready for her work at the
precise minute appointed. Is it not at once seen how a
requisition of this kind will gently force her into habits
of order? If she suffer for being late, because, when
she started for school she could not find her rubbers or
gloves, she will be more careful the next day that they
are in their proper places. If she is late at recitation because
her pencil was not to be found at the call, she will
finally conclude that it would be a better plan to keep
arithmetic, slate and pencil together; and so, almost insensibly,
her books and appointments generally will fall
into groups and classes in her desk. Not only there, but
at home, will the same effect be seen; and not only now,
but through all her life, the habit will run. It needs
only a moment's reflection to show how great will be the
result. Accustomed to collect her thoughts at a certain
time, for a certain work, she will have acquired a mastery
over them which will make her self-controlled, ready in
emergencies, and able to summon her whole mental power
at will for any work when it may be necessary.</p>

<p>Again, that silence should be enforced in school may
be desirable for the immediate quiet resulting therefrom,
but that the continual impulse to talk should be restrained
and held in check by the will, till the subjection of impulse
to will shall become a daily and hourly habit, is a
matter of no less than infinite moment.</p>

<p>And the wise teacher, who must always look beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the present and immediate result, to its future and mediate
consequences, works steadily, through the enforcement
of such regulations, on the formation of the character
of the child under her influence, basing her action
on the rational foundations of the Science of Education,
and mindful ever that the so-called intellectual part of
her work will not be well performed if these be neglected.</p>

<p>Laws and rules are, to her, not an unfortunate necessity,
inseparable from society, but the divinely-appointed
means whereby the human soul shall attain perfect development;
not a record of rights grudgingly surrendered
by the individual for temporal advantage, but the voluntary
placing under foot of capricious impulses, that by
this renunciation the individual may ascend to his own
noblest freedom.</p>

<p>Do not the very weaknesses, habits and failures, which
are considered especially feminine, result from the general
lack in a proper appreciation of the educational value
of strict and exactly enforced rules? It is because little
girls have not, in their educative process, been forced to
accept the responsibility, and to suffer the results of their
own deeds, that they are, in after life, placed in false and
ridiculous positions, when they are forced to come in
contact, whether in housekeeping or in business, with
the rational regulations of business life. They expect,
and take, special privileges, and feel themselves aggrieved
if these are not accorded; they continually place their
own individual opinions or fancies alongside of the necessary
laws of trade, as if the two were to be balanced
for a single moment; they have not learned that there
are times when silence is better than speech, and they
seem to think that a polite apology ought to be accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
by the president and directors of a bank, in lieu of the
payment at the proper time of a protested note.</p>

<p>That these follies are universally characterized, wherever
they occur, by the term &ldquo;a woman's way of doing
business,&rdquo; is sufficient proof that they are characteristic
of the majority of women; but that the cause of the
trouble lies, not in their nature, but in their education is
proved by the fact that wherever women have received
a thorough business training, these charming and bewildering
feminine characteristics, which render them only
a source of confusion, are not found. Co-education is,
in this respect, of incalculable good to our American
girls, for the necessary laws of rational discipline, in a
mixed school, must bear as well on the girls as on the
boys, and the result is, if possible, of greater value to
the girls than to the boys.</p>

<p>When we tell the little girl that she must not insist
on keeping all her playthings tightly hugged to her
bosom, and persuade her to allow her sister to look at
or play with them, when the little arms are slowly unfolded
and the toy half hesitatingly handed over, we behold
the bending of a natural will, and one of the first
victories of the spiritual being. There is a great struggle
going on in the tiny thought. She is probably too young
to be amenable to reasoning, and simply yields to the
force of the already acquired habit of obedience, or to the
force of her affection.</p>

<p>But if she do not yield, if she still hugs the toys in her
natural selfishness, shall we be <i>educating</i> her if by physical
pain we force her to drop them? A single illustration
and question of this kind will show how large interests
are involved in what is seemingly so simple a matter.
The question of how we shall deal with her to force her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to do what she ought to do, cannot be answered without
first determining what is the end in view. Have we simply
in mind as an end that the other child shall have some
of the toys in that particular instance, or is it the training,
the education of the untrained will, of which we are
thinking? And yet the question must be decided at
once. The pouting child stands there in full possession
of all the playthings, her arms rosy with the strain, and
the other child, quite as natural, quite as untrained, is perhaps
preparing to take her share by violence, and cries
aloud for justice. Is it not manifest that every mother&mdash;that
every woman who may have the care of children,
should be so educated that she may guide her conduct in
every such emergency by some established principles, and
with a clear vision of causes and results? How many
such questions come up for settlement in the course of
twelve hours, only a woman who has had for a day the
charge of two or three young children can know; and
how often has she, in the course of half an hour, either
from the result of her decision, or from her own reflection,
become convinced that she has done exactly the thing
which she ought not to have done! This would not be
so often the case if our girls were really educated.</p>

<p>We hold a general in the army responsible for the
mistakes of execution made under his orders, and if he
commit many, we assert him to be incompetent, half-educated,
and demand that he be superseded.</p>

<p>We put a girl who has never had the chance for any
study or comprehension of the only thought which could
give a rational ground for such decisions, at the head of
a family, and when, either in devotion to interests which
she practically thinks of greater importance, or in despair
at her own want of success, fretted and worried beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the power of endurance, she fails in nervous health and
gives up the care of her children to ignorant nurses, we
wonder that American children are so unruly. We sow
the wind and we reap the whirlwind, but the sowing was
done long ago in the narrow and unfinished education
which we gave to our girls, now the mothers.</p>

<p>Politeness does not consist in any outside mannerisms,
nor is it simply kindness. It consists, as a wiser than I
has said, in treating every person as if she were what she
might be, instead of what she actually is. A person tells
us what we know not to be true. We do not contradict
her, which would be treating her as if she intended to
tell a lie, though we may be convinced that such was the
actual case, but we treat her as if she intended to be a
scrupulously truthful person. We speak not to <i>her</i> then,
but to a non-existing ideal of her, when we ask her
politely whether she may not be mistaken, or when we
do not answer at all, thereby assuming that her statement
was correct. Or a self-important salesman insists,
very impolitely, because he thereby implies that we know
nothing of what we desire, that the piece of goods which
we are examining is of charming colors, tastefully combined,
and is in fact the very thing which we most need.
If we answered him as our natural impulse prompts,
&ldquo;according to his folly,&rdquo; we simply treat him as what
he actually is, and we are as impolite as he. The woman
who has been educated into true politeness answers him,
if she answer him at all, as if he were what he actually
is not, a better judge of her needs than she herself is.
And so with all cases of politeness.</p>

<p>It is manifest that no manual of manners or etiquette
of polite society can be of the slightest avail, and all such
would seem beneath notice here, were it not evident from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the number of such books published, and the number
sold, that there is a large demand for them.</p>

<p>Nothing to an observer can be a more comic sight
than the result produced on manners by their faithful
study. It is sufficient for us to try to imagine the man
who of all our acquaintance is the most truly and exquisitely
polite, endeavoring to follow out the cast-iron
rules contained in these books, for us to appreciate the
difference between the politeness which springs from
within and that which is only a shabby veneering. Of
American mothers and American teachers what proportion
are, by having attained a mastership in this art of
politeness, fully able to educate our girls into it? Are
we not a sadly uneducated people?</p>

<p>But there is still something else to be done. In the unrestrained
and affectionate intercourse of the family, the
girl has not felt the necessity of concealing in any degree
her real self. She is under an observation that is intelligent
and sympathetic, and she is sure of the kindest construction
of all her actions. If she talks or laughs loudly,
for instance, it is not supposed that this springs from a
desire to attract attention, but from the natural, innocent
overflowing of healthful spirits, and a forgetfulness of
self. But her social education cannot be called finished
till she has in some measure been taught to distrust
others. She must learn that society is not one vast
family, abounding in sympathy, and always ready to
put the kindest construction on her words and actions.
She must learn this sooner or later. Shall she learn it
by mortifying experiences, by finding herself often in
absurd and annoying positions, by having her confidence
betrayed, and the outspoken utterances resulting from
her very purity of thought made the occasion of coarse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
remarks and suspicions; or shall she be guarded against
all these by being taught that she must not give all the
world credit for being as pure and innocent as she? We
must so educate her that she will not lightly give her
confidence, or show to uninterested persons too much of
her real self. In other words, we must educate her into
a reserve, into the gentle, unoffending dignity which
holds all but the nearest and dearest at a little distance
from herself. This is not teaching deceit. It is only
teaching what must be learned, the means of &ldquo;possessing
one's self in peace.&rdquo; The majority of our girls who talk
and laugh loudly on Broadway, do not do this to attract attention.
They do it simply because their education on
this point is not yet completed. A slight indication of
the same defect in education is the profusion of endearing
pet names, which we find in the published catalogues
of girl students. If the girls themselves do not realize
the impropriety of thus publishing to a world of careless
strangers, the names which family affection has bestowed
upon them, should not the teachers who compile the
catalogues, direct and overrule their uneducated taste?
It is only necessary to imagine the catalogue of Harvard
or Yale, printed in the same manner, to make manifest,
even to the girls themselves, the want of proper dignity
displayed. Men, in their intercourse with the world,
learn sooner than women, by the rough teaching of experience,
the necessity of fending in their inner selves
from the outer world. But both boys and girls might
be saved much time and pain, if parents and guardians
recognized more clearly that this was a part of education.</p>

<p>But in all the training of the will on this social side,
we must never forget, and here lies the greatest problem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
for the educator, that individuality is not to be sacrificed,
that it must be most jealously preserved. We have only
to remember what has been so often said before, that
education consists, not in destroying, but in training.
The will is only to be directed, never to be broken, or
even weakened, and she who endeavors to do this is
working in the interest of evil and not of good, while
she who should, if it were possible, succeed in it, would
have, as the result of her efforts, only a total ruin instead
of a fair and stately edifice. It may often, indeed, become
her duty to strengthen it, for without a strong will,
the moral nature will fall a prey to the forces of evil as
surely and quickly as the body, deprived of the life
principle, rushes to corruption and disintegration.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Moral Culture.</i>&mdash;In the previous division, the will
has been supposed to be guided by the educator, but
now another guide is to be followed, for it becomes
the work of the educator to teach that &ldquo;nothing in
the world has any absolute value except Will guided
by the Right.&rdquo; We must presuppose before we can
produce any great effect in this direction a considerable
education of the intellect, in order that the child
may have some intelligent idea of the Right, otherwise
we shall be leaving her to the saddest mistakes.
The African chief, who, being convinced that it was
right for him, before baptism, to dispense with one of
his two wives, for both of whom he had a sincere affection,
performed, so far as he knew, a highly virtuous action
in eating one of them, and no girl whose intellect
has not been well trained can safely be delivered over to
the direction of her own conscience. The Spanish and
the French mothers tacitly recognize the truth of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
proposition, by the constant surveillance which they exercise
over their daughters. It is contrary to the whole
spirit of our American life to be so watchful. By so
much the more, then, ought we to see to it, that the
conscience, to whose custody American mothers hand
over their daughters' actions, be an enlightened one.
No merely prescriptive external rules, borrowed from
society when the mothers were girls, can fully answer the
purpose. These may do for communities that are comparatively
stationary, but in our rapidly moving American
life, our girls must have a more stable guide.</p>

<p>It is not often recognized that the cause of much
chafing and worry in American homes&mdash;a chafing and a
worry which is scarcely found in Europe&mdash;is only this
truly American phenomenon of rapid national growth.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The mother who was educated only thirty years ago
finds herself unable to understand her daughter's restlessness.
As great a distance divides the thought of the
mother and daughter in America as in Germany lies between
the great-grandmother and the great-granddaughter,
and these latter named relatives are, by a wise provision
of Providence, not often permitted to come into
contact at the time when the girl begins to assert her
own individuality, and hence, the chafing referred to
above, is saved. If Methuselahs were not exceptional in
these days in America, who can estimate to how great a
degree the unavoidable friction of family society would
be increased!</p>

<p>We must never, in this question of education, forget<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
for one moment the peculiar conditions which surround
our girls, from the peculiarities of national government
and society. Again, then, it is, in this point of view,
of imperative importance that our girls be allowed,
nay, forced, to complete their intellectual education.</p>

<p>We have now so to educate the girl that she shall do
what is right, simply because it is right, and not because
it is useful or politic so to do; that she shall abstain from
what is wrong, simply and, only because it is wrong, and
not because it will be harmful to her if she do not.
These two statements would, however, be fully expressed
by the first one, for it is evident that if she always do
what is right she will never be able to do what is wrong,
and positive education is much better than negative, and
an active, better than a passive state of mind. In the
first years of the little girl's life this lesson can be impressed
upon her only by example, and fortunate have
those of us been who, both in grandmother and mother,
from our earliest childhood up, can remember no single
instance, however trifling, of deviation from obedience
to the &ldquo;stern daughter of the voice of God.&rdquo; Though
at first we did not know what the power was, we felt,
through all our childish consciousness, that there was a
power behind the throne from which our laws emanated,
whose voice was authority itself. Some of us may even
recall the impression made upon us, as clear now as in
the long gone years, when we distinctly formulated in
words, with a certain sense of satisfaction, the conviction
that &ldquo;even grown-up people cannot do as they please;&rdquo;
and yet, that the power which prevented this doing as
they pleased was neither fashion, nor custom, nor the
opinion of society.</p>

<p>Let the little girl be so educated that &ldquo;while she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
praises and rejoices over, and receives into her soul, the
good, and becomes noble and good, she will justly blame
and hate the bad, now in the days of her youth, even
before she is able to know the reason of the thing, and
when Reason comes, she will recognize and salute her as
a friend with whom her education has made her long
familiar.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>But when the girl is older, and especially at the time
when the whole character is most impressible, this part
of education can be firmly laid in the cement of rational
conviction, and if it is laid on no shifting sands of contradictory
character in the educator, we may safely trust
to its enduring support. There must be no compromise
here. The doctrines that the good are happy, that honesty
is the best policy, etc., are of no avail. They will
not do as a guide for life, and the sooner American
mothers and teachers learn this, the better for America.</p>

<p>When the girl yields in every direction unquestioning
obedience to Duty, she is virtuous, and she is virtuous
only in so far as she does this. But as duty rules in
every direction, to God, to the State, Society, the Family,
and ourselves, and as her voice is as authoritative at one
time as at another, it follows that no one virtue can be
said to be superior to any other. Those of us who have
had the widest experience have learned that the whole
hierarchy of virtues generally stand or fall together, for
they are all only the making actual of simple duty.</p>

<p>I quote again from Rosenkranz, with regard to a habit
often found among girls: &ldquo;The pupil must be warned
against a certain moral negligence, which consists in
yielding to certain weaknesses, faults or crimes, a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
longer and a little longer, because he has fixed a certain
time, after which he intends to do better. Perhaps he
will assert that his companions, his surroundings, his
position must be changed before he can alter his internal
conduct. Wherever education or temperament favors
sentimentality, we shall find birthdays, New Year's day,
confirmation day, etc., selected as these turning points.
It is not to be denied that man proceeds, in his internal
life, from epoch to epoch, and renews himself in his most
internal nature, nor can we deny that moments like those
mentioned are especially favorable in man to an effort
towards self-transformation, because they invite introspection;
but it is not to be endured that the youth,
while looking forward to such a moment, should consciously
persist in his wrong doing. If he does, when
the solemn moment which he has set, at last arrives, he
will, at the stirring of the first emotion, perceive with
terror that he has changed nothing in himself, that the
same temptations are present to him, and the same weakness
takes possession of him. * * * In morality
there are no vacations and no interims.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The power of voluntary Renunciation is another
power which the educator has to develop in the girl.
It can be cultivated, of course, only by judicious exercise.</p>

<p>But the formation of Character is the great work of
the educator, for this may be said to be the object of a
woman's existence. Character has been defined as &ldquo;a
completely fashioned Will&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a completely educated
Will. If it is &ldquo;completely fashioned,&rdquo; it must of neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>sity
be consistent. It is scarcely necessary here to call
attention to the fact that by character, in any educational
sense, we mean that which the woman really is&mdash;not
what she is thought to be by others.</p>

<p>Character may, it is evident, be either good or bad;
for one may be consistently bad as well as consistently
good. But we are concerned only with the building of
character where that building means the &ldquo;making permanent
the direction of the individual Will towards the
actualization of the good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman of good character is she who, while she
acts spontaneously, acts in all things consistently; the
parts of whose life grow together, as it were, into one
organic unity. We know what to expect of her. In her
friendship we confide, on her love we safely rely, by her
judgment, provided she has been intellectually educated,
we regulate our action in times of difficulty and distress.
&ldquo;The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, and
her children rise up and call her blessed,&rdquo; and when she
passes through the gate of death, her country should
mourn, for it can ill-afford to miss her.</p>


<h3>RELIGIOUS CULTURE.</h3><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When the girl has learned to accept duty as the decisive
guide of her actions, she is acting conscientiously, and
passes over into the real religious life. A distinction must
be here made between Religion and Theology, the latter
of which belongs to special educators. At first, in the
child, religion is a feeling, a sentiment, which the mother
generally fosters and directs. It appears in the form
of wonder at natural phenomena, of fear and terror
when these are disagreeable, and of gratitude when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
are agreeable. But this feeling or sentiment of religion
the savage has, and it properly belongs, in civilized Christian
communities, only to the period of childhood. If
the little girl be not educated into a higher religion than
this, and if, at the same time, her whole mental horizon
have, from unfinished intellectual education, remained
narrow, she has nothing on which any teaching of Theology
can be based, and nothing which will bear the stress
and strain of actual life. In such a case&mdash;that is, if her
religion is only gratitude for favors, if her only idea of
God is that of a Benefactor&mdash;when benefits fail, her religion
will fail also. While she has all that she can desire,
she is full of religious faith. She loses parents, husband,
and only child, and her faith has vanished, and she even
doubts whether there be any God, since he can allow so
much misery. She asks why, if he were good and kind
and loved his children, he could not have divided his
gifts more equally, why he could not have taken one child
from her neighbor who has seven, instead of her one
ewe lamb. Allowance must be made for the first unreason
of terrible torture to the affections, and the first heart-broken
exclamations are not always to be trusted as an
index of the religious faith. But when in many a woman,
this becomes a chronic state of mind, is it not a serious
question for educators to ask, whether the fault does not
lie in her narrow education? Ought she not to have had
her intellect so cultured that she should be able to hold
at once in her thought, and without confusion, these two
truths: that God's thought and care for the Universe
must be a thought of Law which cannot be broken for
individual cases, and also that even one sparrow does not
fall without his notice?</p>

<p>Ought she not to have been educated into so wide a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
horizon of thought that she herself, and her affairs, her
loves, and hates, should not loom up before her in such
disproportionate size? A woman is to live in her affections?
But what if her affections have been outraged,
betrayed, or crushed? The sentiment is a very good
one, but it is but sentiment still, and our American girls
will not be less strong in their affections if we educate
them into thought and knowledge, as well as into emotion
and blind belief. If the mere religious feeling which
belonged to the child is not led over into a something
stronger and surer, it becomes morbid and degenerates
into sentimentality and mysticism. Can we afford to let
the strong feeling in our American girls be lost for all
real good, in this way? Shall we not rather direct it by
a sound religious education, into more healthy channels?
In such a completed education alone can we find the
ground for any active acceptance of our lot. &ldquo;The constant
new birth out of the grave of the past, to the life of
a more beautiful future, is the only genuine reconciliation
with destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>Only when we have accomplished such an education
as this for our American girls, the best material the world
has ever yet seen, may we safely trust the interests of
future generations to their strong, intelligent, and religious
guidance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<h3>A MOTHER'S THOUGHT<br />
ON THE</h3>
<h2><span class="smcap">Education of Girls.</span></h2>

<p>There is no situation in life more freighted with responsibility
than that of the mother of girls, be it one or
many, the one as heavy as the many, because the only
child is less naturally situated; and therefore upon the
mother rests the necessity of intentionally providing
many influences which are spontaneously produced in a
large and varied family circle.</p>

<p>I emphasize also the responsibility of the education of
girls over boys for the same reason, because girls are
more largely withdrawn from the natural education of
life and circumstances than boys, and their development
seems to depend more exclusively upon the individual
influence of the mother.</p>

<p>The public school, the play-ground, the freedom of
boyish sports, the early departure from home to college
or business, the prizes offered to ambition, all exercise a
powerful influence upon the boy, tending to modify the
action of the mother's conscious training. More powerful
than her intellectual and determined effort is usually
her affectional influence, swaying him unconsciously and
giving him always a centre for his heart and life, to
which he returns from all his wanderings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>For men, too, life, with all its evil, seems to be measurably
adjusted. We do not hear constant discussions of
men's sphere and men's education. Each man is left
very much to work out his own career, without the responsibility
of the whole sex resting upon him. He is
at liberty to make mistakes in his medical practice, to
blow up steamboats by his carelessness, to preach dull
sermons, and write silly books, without finding his whole
sex put under ban for his shortcomings, and so he works
with a sense of individual power and responsibility which
calls out his energies, and educates him even in spite of
the foolish cosseting of a mother or the narrow pedantry
of a teacher.</p>

<p>But in regard to woman, there is a general confession
that life is not yet well adapted to her needs, or she to
her place in the world. There is a perpetual effort to readjust
her claims, to define her position, and to map out
her sphere, and these boundary lines are arbitrarily drawn
at every conceivable distance from the centre, so that
what seems extravagant latitude to one, is far within the
narrowest limits of another.</p>

<p>Very few have arrived at the conclusion that woman's
nature, like man's, is self-determining, and that her
character and her powers must decide her destiny; that
instead of prescribing the outward limits of her action, the
important point is to increase her energy, to regulate her
activity by self-discipline, to purify her nature by nobility
of thought and sentiment, and then to leave her free to
work out her thought into life as she can and must.</p>

<p>But this, it seems to me, should be the grand leading
principle of a mother in the education of her daughter,
to give her such faith in herself, such knowledge of the
laws of her own being, such trust in the guiding power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of the universe, that she will have a principle of life and
growth within her which will react upon all outward
circumstances and turn them into means of education.</p>

<p>It is in this freedom alone that the essential meaning
of her nature will show itself. In free, conscious obedience
to law, natural limitations become a source of power,
as the hardness of the marble gives effect to the sculptor's
forming stroke; but all arbitrary restraints dwarf and deform
the growing soul.</p>

<p>But in the very beginning a great difficulty meets the
mother of the girl who seeks to train her up into glad,
free acceptance of life, for instead of general rejoicing in
the birth of her child, too often there is a wail of discontent
over the hapless infant who is &ldquo;not a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is an idea very deeply grounded in our social feeling,
that it is a misfortune and an indignity to be a woman.
True, all men do not, like the Jews in the old service,
insultingly thank God that he has not made them women,
while the meek woman plaintively thanks God that
he has made her at all. But how constantly is the
thought and feeling expressed, that the boy is a more
welcome comer into the family circle than the girl, and
that the woman is to have a hard fate in life. And if
the popular idea of woman be true, is it not a great calamity
to be born a girl? &ldquo;If man must work, and woman
must weep,&rdquo; who would not choose the former lot? It is
a very common thing to hear women wish most earnestly
from their earliest to their latest hour of life, that they
had been born men. It is very rarely that the youngest
boy wishes to be a girl, or that men covet the vaunted
privileges of womanhood.</p>

<p>Margaret Fuller alludes feelingly to this prevailing
sentiment in her noble <i>Essay on Woman</i>, and quotes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Southey the despairing cry of the Paraguay Woman,
&ldquo;lamenting that her mother did not kill her the
hour she was born&mdash;her mother, who knew what the life
of a woman must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And yet, it seems to me, any woman is entirely unfit
to educate her daughter who has not so sifted her life
experience, so learned the meaning of her creation, so
separated the accidents and follies of to-day from the
divine purpose, as to read clearly the meaning of life,
and to accept for her daughter, as for herself, the great
fact of her womanhood; not with submission merely, but
with a joyful recognition of its wonderful possibilities
and its supreme glories.</p>

<p>That this is possible to achieve, I might bring the testimony
of women speaking from the midst of suffering
and anguish, and yet rejoicing in the spiritual ideal of
womanhood. Mrs. Eliza Farnham has done great service
by her eloquent vindication of the claims of womanhood,
which she bases on very noble spiritual truths.
But too often the high estimate of woman is placed on
purely &aelig;sthetic and sentimental grounds, and does not
satisfy the demands either of mind or heart in the hour
of trial, or the practical common sense applied to daily
life. It hardly strengthens a woman, to be told that
women are more angelic by nature, more amiable, more
religious, and more holy than men, when she is suffering
from excessive nervous irritability, from neglected solitude,
from want of employment suited to her feeble
powers, or from the unused energies of mind and body
which are devouring her day by day&mdash;to be called an
angel, when she is only a drudge, is not consoling.</p>

<p>The work must be begun early in life, and the mind
of the girl must be braced by a recognition of natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
law to the acceptance of all the conditions of her nature.
But for this she must learn to distinguish between the
ideal and the actual, between woman's nature as God
designed it, and her nature as long years of hereditary
sin and disease and false custom have made it; between
the unfallen Eve, the last best work of Creation, and
the daughters of corruption and luxury, bearing the sins
of their fathers and their mothers for more than three or
four generations.</p>

<p>The mother must be prepared to meet the terrible
questionings of her daughter on those points of physiology
which are still baffling the most candid observers.</p>

<p>She should prepare herself for this duty by obtaining
all the knowledge of the subject that is possible to her.
She will find that the laws of the human organization
are marked by the same wisdom and beauty as those of
the physical world; and many things which seemed
dark and cruel will be seen to be beneficent and beautiful
when their whole relation is understood. She may then
give some reasonable answer to the question which the
young intellect, struggling with the great problems of
physical life, is so prone to ask, &ldquo;Why was I thus made?&rdquo;
It helps us very much to learn the <i>how</i>, even if we can
never solve the <i>why.</i></p>

<p>Every mother has not the power to answer these questions
scientifically; but if she have it herself, she can at
least inspire in her child a firm faith that everything in
creation has its meaning and its use, and that until the
workings of any function are made to promote the highest
health and welfare of every human being, its law has not
been discovered and obeyed.</p>

<p>The very search after the answer to her inquiry, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
often the healthful exercise of mind which will drive
away morbid doubts.</p>

<p>Health is the holiness of the body, and every girl
should have a high standard of perfect health set before
her, and be made to feel that she has no more right to
trifle with and disobey the hygienic laws, than those of
morality or civil society. She should be as much ashamed
of illness brought on by her own folly, as of being
whipped at school for disobedience to her teacher.</p>

<p>But how low, on the contrary, is the standard of health
for woman! A thoroughly strong, able-bodied woman is
almost an unknown ideal to American society.</p>

<p>A physician pleading before a legislative committee of
Massachusetts a few years ago, bade the gentlemen
present he grateful for their happy lot in being exempt
from the infirmities that beset women. A very admirable
teacher once said to me, &ldquo;I tell my girls they
mustn't complain if they do have to lose a year or two
by ill health, it is hardly to be expected they should not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michelet treats semi-invalidism as the natural, inevitable,
and charming condition of women. A perfectly
healthy woman he considers to have lost her great
charm. Science makes the astonishing discovery, that
on the whole, women average a little smaller than men,
and society seems to accept the idea that therefore, the
smaller they are, the more womanly. But before we decide
upon this puny condition as the necessary state of
woman, let us look at some of the facts on the other side,
and see what are the possibilities of physical strength
and health compatible with womanhood. In the University
of Michigan, pursuing her studies equally with
the young men, is a young woman from Kentucky, who
measures six feet two inches in height, and is well pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>portioned.
She has a younger sister there who is already
five feet eight inches high, and growing very fast. At
the South, the negro women performed every kind of
labor in the field, and were said to plough better than
men. In Europe all kinds of hard work are performed
by poor women; even yoked with animals for draught.
In England women are employed in stacking large bars
of iron. In Dahomey the Amazonian guards of the
king perform all military duty with equal ease and thoroughness
with men. Now, if these things be possible to
women of the poorer classes, and of other countries, it
proves that it is not her essential womanhood, but her
artificial life and her inherited weakness that makes the
lady of Western Europe and America an habitual invalid.</p>

<p>And this muscular power, though not the only essential
to health, is of the very first importance, and, within
proper bounds, is absolutely requisite for the healthy and
full development of animal life. It is possible to carry
muscular activity too far, or rather to make it exclusive
of the exercise of other powers. The gladiator of old
was not found to make the best soldier, nor did the wood-cutter
bear the fatigues of the war as well as the cultivated
citizen. But as a basis for other culture it is all-important.
And it is especially needful for woman, for
the great peculiar function of maternity requires the
finest muscular power. It is the want of it, among other
causes, which produces the pains and perils of child-birth,
which are almost unknown to women of savage life.
&ldquo;The women of Abyssinia,&rdquo; says a missionary there;
&ldquo;never rest more than two or three days after child-birth,&rdquo;
while in luxurious Athens, where women of the higher
ranks were kept alike from physical and mental exertion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
six weeks of seclusion was considered absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The German mother begins at the birth of her infant
daughter to spin and weave the linen which is to form
her dowry in marriage. If all mothers would begin
to lay up for their daughters a dowry of muscular
energy and nervous strength from the time of their birth,
how would the mythical curse be removed from maternity,
and the saddest of all deaths, that of the young wife
in the first child-birth, be as rare as it is in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The first requisite for the mother is to believe in a
possible happy destiny for her child, and to seek to secure
it for her.</p>

<p>One great secret of all art, and therefore of all education,
is the nice balancing of the generic with the special
or the individual. Coleridge says &ldquo;this is the true meaning
of the ideal in art.&rdquo; False culture, by the emphasis
laid upon peculiarities of race, sex, or families, develops
these peculiarities more and more, and tends to produce
monstrosities, while nature always strives to mix the
breed and restore the original type.</p>

<p>Nature has her own boundaries, which she does not
pass over, but they are always delicate and nicely adjustable.
When the gardener wishes bleached celery, or
seedless bananas, or monster squashes, he gives special
food in the soil of the plants, or covers them from the
sun, or nips off the spraying tendrils, that he may produce
the variety he covets, but when the farmer would
raise corn or wheat for the millions, he ploughs deep into
the soil of the prairie, sows his seed broadcast, and
trusts it to the free influences of the sun and the winds,
and the harvest that he reaps is reproductive, and may
be multiplied for hundreds of years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>It is curious in tracing the progress of both vegetable
and animal life upwards towards humanity, to see how
nature plays with the secondary distinctions of sex. The
great distinction always remains of the fertilizing and
the reproductive function; but as regards size, beauty,
the care of the young, and all moral and mental qualities,
there is the greatest diversity of manifestation. In
some species, even, the male builds the nest and protects
the offspring from the ferocious mother, who, like Saturn,
devours her own children, and sometimes, among fishes,
even her mate. So is it in regard to the mental differences
between men and women. Few persons will deny
that the difference of sex which runs through creation,
colors every part of life; and yet the difference is so delicate,
and so varied, that I have never heard any broad
statement which was not liable to sufficient exceptions to
destroy its value. I have again and again asked teachers
of mixed schools, What difference do you find between
the proficiency of the boys and girls in their various
studies? Where differences have been pointed out, they
have often been just opposite in different schools, one
claiming mathematics, another languages, another grammar,
or logic, as specially adapted to feminine taste or
capacity.</p>

<p>So, in human education the first attention should be
given to bringing out the broad, healthy powers of
human nature, not to increasing any peculiar attributes.
&ldquo;How much of life,&rdquo; asked Margaret Fuller, &ldquo;is the life
neither of man or of woman, but of Humanity?&rdquo; Every
mother should seek to lay a firm foundation in this common
ground of Humanity, out of which the special flowers
will grow more rich and abundant.</p>

<p>Especially should all premature recognition of sex be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
avoided; nature should be allowed to develop slowly and
quietly. Sex must be recognized; the names of brother
and sister, the slight difference in costume are sufficient,
but in play and work, and especially in dress and manners,
the early distinctions between the sexes tend to produce
mannishness on one side and effeminacy on the
other. The girl's dress may be a little different in form,
but why should the boy wear stout gingham or warm
flannel, and she be clothed in fragile muslin, or expensive
silk? Why should he be able to climb fences or
leap ditches without risk to his clothes, and she be kept
in perpetual bondage by her ribbons and her ruffles?
Look at a boy's simple round straw or felt hat, with a
plain band about it, and pity the little girl with her delicate
chip and a wreath of artificial flowers. Is it because
the girl's physique is more delicate and complicated, that
she is thus denied the natural and healthy exercise of
her powers, and burdened with a load of finery under
which the strong man would halt and stagger? The
more delicate the organization, the smaller the lungs,
the more absolutely important is perfect freedom of
dress and motion, and the more essential is life in the
open air. If we must keep any of the children in-doors
let it be the boys; they will have out-door life afterwards,
but let girlhood have its free play before custom and
fashion fetter it forever. So, too, in manners; how many
mothers apologize for their unendurable little ruffians by
saying, &ldquo;You know boys will be rude!&rdquo; Why should
boys be rude? Is not <i>gentleman</i> our highest term for
all that is honorable and manly? The physical power
that is not under the control of higher qualities is rude,
but rudeness is not evidence of power, only witness to
the want of culture. A sadly pathetic vein runs through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Miss Edgeworth's children's stories, especially <i>Frank</i>,
in the difference she makes in the life of man and woman.
The children make a list of the virtues which should be
cultivated by men and women, and courage is put down
very low on the woman's side and first on the man's.
But there is no sex in morals, and until courage is
deemed essential to woman and purity to man there can
be no moral perfection in either.</p>

<p>Still more is the direct appeal to sexual differences to
be avoided in early childhood. Many foolish parents
encourage the custom of having little beaux and juvenile
flirtations, and even very young children are taught
games in which the boy takes out a girl as his partner,
and the reverse. I once saw a dear little girl about four
years old put her arm affectionately around the neck of a
little playmate, and her father said, &ldquo;Oh, for shame,
you shouldn't kiss a boy.&rdquo; Could he have answered her
simple question, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is one of the important benefits of the co-education
of the sexes. Brought up together in schools as in families,
side by side, from early childhood, there is no false
mystery about their relation. Their common life is developed,
and they value each other for individual qualities.
I have never found an exception to the statement
by teachers of mixed schools, that there is less of nonsense,
less of false sentimentality and precocious sexual
attraction, than where the boys and girls are kept separate.</p>

<p>In life as in art those characters are the finest in which
the distinction of sex is recognized but not emphasized&mdash;in
which the human nature preponderates over that of
man or woman. In the Hercules, the masculine attributes
are exaggerated almost to repulsiveness, but in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Apollo they are present, but they never intrude themselves
upon our attention. Vigor, freedom, life, and action, the inspiration
of genius, joy in existence, are his attributes, and
while the muses are feminine, he is the god of poesy and
music. So the Milo Venus has all the traits of womanhood,
but not in excess, and her sweet, dignified presence
reminds us that she is a goddess, and not a weak, self-conscious
woman, like the Medicean image. But the type of
womanhood in western Europe and America has emphasized
all that is weak, all that is sentimental, all that is helpless
in woman, and attenuated it to such delicate proportions
as to give it a strange and unnatural charm, like the
beauty of consumption. Let us recognize it as an exquisite
creation of art, not of nature, as wonderful as the
pouter pigeon or the saffron rose. The delicate whiteness
of the complexion, scarcely tinged with pink, the
fine silky hair, the fragile, willowy form, the tiny hand
and foot, the languid blue eye, the soft, low voice, the
sensitive nerves that shrink from every breath of heaven,
and weep at every tale of woe, the slight cough that
touches your compassion, the trembling step that appeals
to you for help, are not these all characteristic of that
fair, frail, lovely being, to whom sonnets are written and
homage tendered when she is young and rich.</p>

<p>A celebrated painter once heard a woman of this stamp
commended as &ldquo;very graceful.&rdquo; &ldquo;Graceful!&rdquo; he indignantly
exclaimed, &ldquo;weakness isn't grace! strength and
agility are the conditions of grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the services of true art is to hold before us
models of beauty which keep the eye pure amid the corruptions
of fashion. The Diana does not suggest any
training of corsets or wearing of long skirts, yet poetry
and fiction have helped to perpetuate this idea of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
lady. Shakespeare has given us his Ophelia and Desdemona,
creations of this false theory, and I have heard
men declare them to be perfect types of womanhood. In
Ruffini's charming story of <i>Doctor Antonio</i>, we have
the same lovely heroine in our prosaic modern life. But
mark how all these women utterly fail in the great hours
of trial. All untrue to the demands of their love, all incapable
of mating the men who have sought them. But
in Portia, in Miranda, in Imogen, we have women in
whom is all the charm of womanhood without its exaggeration;
they are independent noble existences, capable
of living alone, and therefore able to meet nobly all the
conditions of life and of love.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>We can almost forgive Charles Reade's later flippant
creations of women, in whom moral weakness is considered
as great a charm as physical delicacy, when we
remember the charming picture of health and vigor which
he first gave us in &ldquo;Christie Johnstone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while this admirable modesty of nature is the
finest grace of humanity, yet there are limits which cannot
safely be overpassed. Nature rarely suffers one sex
really to pass the common boundary and take on the special
attributes of the other, seeming only to permit these extreme
cases as warning and landmark. The contralto in
woman and the tenor in man are delightful, but when the
woman's voice is bass or the man's treble the impression
is ludicrous.</p>

<p>In due time the great distinction of sex rightly asserts
itself, and the delicate distinctions between man and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
woman, so easy to feel and so difficult to state, begin to
be recognized. Then the broad general law of humanity
will come to a more definite and varied expression in
special natures. And although the mother will never
forget the common ground of humanity which must underlie
all training, she will prepare to meet the peculiar
claims of her daughter's nature, and help her to understand
and appreciate her needs and her powers.</p>

<p>The child instinctively begins to inquire into physiological
questions concerning marriage, birth, etc. There
is but one way in which such questions should be met&mdash;with
perfect truth in perfect reverence. To little children,
utterly incapable of understanding the truth, the
pretty fables of the stork or the angel may be harmless,
but all earnest inquiries should be met with the simple
truth as far as it can be understood, and the promise of
full explanation whenever the mind is mature to receive
it. The mother should anticipate this natural need
of the mind for knowledge, and should prepare her daughter
for initiation into the higher mysteries of human life
by an acquaintance with life in its simpler forms, where
it is not complicated by human passions. The functions
of reproduction in vegetable life are the natural method
of instruction, and lead the way to a recognition of the
sacredness and beauty of the whole subject. The child's
delight in the flowers of the field is easily deepened into
intellectual instruction by pointing out the functions of the
various organs and their beautiful adaption to use. In
the care with which variety is sought the important lesson
against intermarriage may be recognized, which fable
and theology has surrounded with such fearful imaginings.</p>

<p>Next, the care of domestic animals will naturally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
interest the child, and from her kittens and her hens she
will learn much, without excitement or effort, that will
form a basis for the higher truths of human physiology.</p>

<p>The mother should thus always anticipate in her own
mind the needs of the daughter, and prepare her for the
changes in her physical condition which will come with maturity,
in the simplest, the tenderest, and the most reverent
manner. Everything approaching to levity or coarseness
of speech should be utterly avoided, so that, while
the young girl will speak frankly and without shame to
her mother or her physician, she will shun light speaking
to chance companions as she would blasphemy.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> And
here the great lesson of a high standard of health should
be re-enforced. There is no function of woman's nature
which in its right exercise does not tend to strengthen,
refresh, and revivify her physical and mental powers. If
healthy, no one need interfere with any rational enjoyment,
any reasonable amount of intellectual labor, or
necessary work. All functions will be best regulated by
a full, harmonious, normal development of all. And in
physiology as in religion, the grand paradox holds true,
&ldquo;that he who loveth his life shall lose it, and he that
hateth it for my sake shall find it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no surer way to destroy the health than to
care for nothing beside it; and the most important condition
for the young girl approaching maturity is to
have her thoughts turned from herself to wide and large
interests, and to have her mind and body healthily and
regularly occupied. When any organ is feeble or diseased,
the thing most to be avoided is fastening the mind
upon its functions, so that nervous irritability or congestion
is produced. And yet, as I have constantly intimated,
the actual mother has to deal not alone with ideal
womanhood, in full possession of a birthright of health,
but very likely with a feeble and diseased being, who
develops new forms of evil in every crisis of life. There
she must be the watchful guardian, and recognize the
limitations of her individual child, and with wise provision
apportion the tasks and the pleasures to her peculiar
needs.</p>

<p>While all sickness is the result of broken law, it is
rarely mainly the sufferer's own fault; and the mother
will tenderly and lovingly shield her sickly child, and
show her the rich compensations which are possible to
her in mental and spiritual life, though she should never
fall into the morbid error of believing physical weakness
to be the most favorable condition of spiritual welfare.</p>

<p>But if she is conscientious and true, really seeking
her child's best good, instead of the indulgence of the
hour, she will be more likely to err on the side of too
much care than too little.</p>

<p>Even in such cases, she should seek more a positive
than a negative care; striving rather to brace and fortify
her daughter against the ills of life, than to shield
her from them. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said wise Dr. Jackson,
&ldquo;the danger is in staying in the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For this reason, books especially written for the instruction
of girls are often very pernicious. They emphasize
certain topics in their relation to woman, and so excite disgust
and produce abnormal excitement, where the simple
teachings of science, reverently enforced, would produce
only a sacred respect for law. The great responsibility
of the transmission of hereditary qualities, may be early
taught without any mental excitement. A little girl of
twelve years old said to her teacher one day: &ldquo;When
you told me to brush my teeth, I thought, why should
I&mdash;of what consequence will it be, fifty years hence,
whether I do so or not; and then I thought that if I
ever had a child, if I had bad teeth, she would be more
likely to&mdash;wouldn't she?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the teacher
with deep seriousness; &ldquo;and that is a most sacred reason
for guarding your own health and strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps no subject has been more fully dwelt upon
than the danger of great intellectual activity for girls
at this youthful period of life, and it has come to be
thought that an idle brain insures a healthy body. But
nothing can be more false. The brain, as the ruling
organ of the body, requires a healthy, rich development;
and this can only be secured by regular exercise and
training, fully using but not overstraining its powers.</p>

<p>The usual accompaniments of intellectual study are
the cause of this false prejudice. Close school-rooms,
late hours of study, restless excitement from over-stimulated
ambition, have no necessary connection with intellectual
progress. Much of the evil effect of schools
comes not from too much intellectual activity, but from
too little; from listless hours spent over lessons which
under good conditions could be learned in half the time.
Mental action, continued after the brain is weary, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
when it is not nourished by fresh blood, or under any
disadvantages of physical condition which prevent it
from being easy and delightful, will injure the system;
and will prove a waste of mental power as well as of
physical health. The greatest lesson that we have to
learn in our mental life, is to value quality of work more
and quantity less. Everybody knows how much more
exhilaration and less fatigue is experienced from a brisk
walk, than from standing listlessly around for double the
length of time; and it is just so with mental effort. We
want neither feverish, excited work, nor lazy work; but
earnest, hard, vigorous effort, ceasing when the brain is
weary or the object is accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>I have yet to see the first proof in man or woman, that
well-regulated activity of the brain injures the health.
I have known many instances where vigor of body was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
restored by earnest mental life; and I believe that more
young women sink into invalidism, or die prematurely,
from the want of adequate thorough mental training,
than from any other one physical or mental cause.</p>

<p>For we must remember that the brain craves thought,
as the stomach does food; and where it is not properly
supplied it will feed on garbage. Where a Latin, geometry,
or history lesson would be a healthy tonic, or nourishing
food, the trashy, exciting story, the gossiping book
of travels, the sentimental poem, or, still worse, the coarse
humor or thin-veiled vice of the low romance, fills up
the hour&mdash;and is at best but tea or slops, if not as dangerous
as opium or whisky. Lord Bacon says most
truly: &ldquo;Too much bending breaks the bow; too much
unbending, the mind.&rdquo; After labor, rest is sweet and
healthful; but all rest is as dangerous as all labor.</p>

<p>One great trouble in women's intellectual life is that
it is too much mere study, too little work with a purpose.
It is all income without an outlet, and that, we know, always
produces congestion and disease. Mental dyspepsia
might be the diagnosis of many an irritable, unhappy
woman. She has eaten, but for want of exercise she
cannot digest the intellectual food she has received. An
active pursuit, an earnest purpose, is to the mind what
out-door air and exercise are to the body. But in our
present social system, where it is still considered out of
place for a lady to work for her living, it is the hardest
problem for a mother to solve, how to supply this most
important need of her daughter. Mental and moral influences
are as real active agents in hygienic life as material
ones. The reaction from asceticism, which despised
the body and made it only a hindrance, or, at best, a
slave to the soul, is in danger of going so far as to forget<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the rightful supremacy and control of the mental powers.
A high purpose is often the best of tonics, as an agreeable
amusement is the most refreshing of sedatives. A
determination to live and work has kept many a person
from the grave. But it must be a strong, calm, persistent
purpose that will have this good effect, not the feverish
ambition of an hour. The girl who works to gain a
prize or to rush through school in less than the usual
time, will doubtless exhaust her nervous system, and bring
on disease or feebleness; but she who looks forward to a
life of noble usefulness will learn to husband her powers,
and make the future secure by wise forbearance in the
present.</p>

<p>When circumstances do not supply the needed stimulus
to use of the mental faculties, by a demand for present
work, the mother may keep before the mind of her daughter
the great duty of preparation for contingencies that
may arise, and show her how the rapid changes now
taking place in our social system may at any time bring
her new duties and responsibilities, for which she will
need all her physical and mental powers.</p>

<p>When Harriet Beecher was the leading spirit in a
girls' society for mental improvement, she did not know
that the intellectual gifts there developed would enable
her to strike the keenest blow that slavery ever received
in this country. When Maria Mitchell studied astronomy
with her father she could not tell that a professorship
at Vassar College awaited her, and that her thorough fitness
for it would prove a tower of strength to the cause
of higher education for women throughout the country.
Keep the sword bright, keen, and well tempered, and opportunity
will come to use it in defense of truth and
right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>I have said little, directly, of school education, because
there comes in the teacher's influence, and, as regards intellectual
training, it is usually better than the mother's.
And though the mother should never yield her right of interest
and ultimate appeal, yet, having selected a teacher,
she should give her generous confidence and conscientious
support. But she must always be watchful to guard
her daughter's health, most of all against herself. From
my own observation I should say that the overwork and
over-stimulus complained of in schools is far more often
the fault of pupils and parents than of teachers. The
calm, steady work which lays a foundation for future
mental power, is not appreciated, and brilliant results are
demanded at once.</p>

<p>And here I wish to speak of the study of music, as it
is usually pursued. From the tradition of David's soothing
Saul by his harp, has, I believe, arisen an idea that
music is a thoroughly healthful, refreshing influence,
with a wonderful soothing power over the nerves. And
yet the nervous excitability, and even irritability, of
musicians is proverbial. We must make nice distinctions.
The influence of hearing music is one thing, the
study of music is another. Unquestionably the power
of music to lift the mind into fresh regions of enjoyment,
to change the current of thought, to rouse and quicken
the nervous action, and so to vivify and raise the tone of
health and spirits is very great. I have known those to
whom it is the best of medicine, and whom I believe it
has saved through severe trials, from utter despair and
morbidness.</p>

<p>But even listening to music such as we now hear is a
high intellectual exercise. A symphony of Beethoven's,
with its complicated movements and rich harmonies, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
quite another thing from the simple melodies with which
Browning so beautifully represents David as soothing
the troubled spirit of Saul. And when to these are
added the passionate fervor of the opera, the tax upon
the nervous system is very great. Properly to hear and
appreciate the opera of <i>Fidelio</i> or <i>Don Giovanni</i> or the
<i>Seventh Symphony</i> of Beethoven requires as much exercise
of brain as to listen to a scientific lecture. I do not
deny its value as an influence, but it is a positive value,
not a negative one. It is <i>re-creation</i> rather than relaxation,
and is no more fit to succeed a long, exhausting day
of study than a sermon, or a disputation, or any other
change of intellectual exercise. Still more is the study
of music, and the practice necessary to acquire command
over so difficult an instrument as the piano, a very great
tax upon the nervous strength of our young people.
Many mothers consider the music lesson only as the
using up of so many minutes of time, and think it may
rightfully be put into any hour of holiday or rest. I
have heard music teachers say that their pupils came to
them weary and listless, and their parents seemed to have
no idea of the amount of intellectual and even physical
exertion which the music lesson required. We cannot
all become fine musical performers, but if the mind is
well developed, with a healthy sensibility of feeling and
culture of imagination, we can get all the influence and
enjoyment of art from the works of thoroughly educated
and creative artists, and we shall do so with more relish,
without the weary remembrance of mechanical practicing
uninspired by active interest.</p>

<p>Music leads the way to a world of the greater danger
from over-stimulus of feeling and sentiment, than of intellectual
work. Few physicians allow enough for the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>mediate
effect of spiritual causes upon the physical health.
Cheerful influences, sunny surroundings, happy relations,
will save one through heavy tasks of work or privation;
but any blight of the affections, any misunderstanding,
or treachery of friends, the lowering of one's
ideal of life and humanity, will depress the nervous system
and ruin the health far more surely than even overwork
of the purely intellectual faculties. Often intellectual
labor is the true antidote and corrective of this
state of feeling.</p>

<p>Theodore Parker once recommended a course of metaphysical
study to a young lady, who, from physical weakness
and other causes, had become morbidly nervous and
introspective.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the importance of thorough healthful
training of body and mind in view of the natural
conditions of marriage and maternity, which may be the
lot of every woman. It is not possible to overstate the
importance or the sanctity of these relations, but it is
possible to look so much at the mere outside facts of
marriage as to ignore its real meaning.</p>

<p>The woman, falsely or carelessly mated, is far less
married than she who keeps her ideal high and true and
remains single; not because she values marriage too little,
but because she has too great reverence to enter into
it lightly or falsely. And the mother has far more need
to fit her daughter to meet nobly the possibilities of unwedded
life, than even the duties of marriage. Marriage
is so perfectly natural a state, that it reveals its own
laws; and a simple, healthful, happy, trusting love, will
guide woman more wisely than much precept.</p>

<p>But in our present social state, the probability for any
girl is by no means small that she may be called on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
live out her life without entering upon this blessed relation.
If she has been taught that woman's sphere is
marriage and marriage alone, that only by that means
can she hope for a life of happiness, usefulness, and respect,
she will probably become a miserable, helpless,
lonely, irritable woman&mdash;perhaps seeking marriage at
any price to escape from the condition she dreads; or
failing that, finding life without purpose, occupation,
or delight.</p>

<p>But if she has learned that Providence is boundless in
its resources, and that when one way is closed, another
is opened, so that &ldquo;all things work together for good;&rdquo;
if she knows that her nature will be far nobler without
the form of marriage unless the spirit and truth can be
present also, she will find that there is a life open to
her a life of devotion to truth, right, and beauty, of
service to humanity, and of love just as noble and true
as she could attain in marriage. She is not fit to marry
until she is fit to stand alone. Unless life has a purpose and
meaning of its own to her as well as to her husband, she
cannot bring him an equal dower, and she has no test of
the new feeling which should take its value from the richness
of the life that she is ready to blend with another's.</p>

<p>Nothing marks the progress in the elevation of woman,
during the last half century, more than the passing
away of the opprobrious use of the term &ldquo;old maid,&rdquo;
which is now rarely heard.</p>

<p>It is possible to remain unmarried from low motives,
shrinking from the duties and responsibilities of the relation,
or from a worldly ambition for higher station than
love can offer. Such sin brings its own terrible punishment
with it. But far more often it is from a high ideal
of marriage, from true nobility of character, or from de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>votion
to some other relation which seemed paramount,
that a woman remains single. How many a woman,
hiding in her secret heart the romance that gave a charm
to her youth, but did not find its reality in life, has devoted
herself to the service of humanity with all the
passionate devotion of a lover to his mistress! Of such
an one, to whom hundreds of helpless babes looked up as
to a guardian and protector, an artist said, &ldquo;She has the
mother in her face.&rdquo; We owe too much to this noble
class of women, in art, literature, and philanthropy, and in
the service of the country in its most trying hour, ever
to forget their claims, and he will be forever stigmatized
as unworthy of the name of pure and noble manhood who
sneers at the virtue which he cannot understand, or vilifies
with opprobrious epithets the noble women whom Theodore
Parker&mdash;God bless him for the word&mdash;called his
&ldquo;glorious phalanx of old maids.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Another wrong is often done to the young girl, under
the name of prudence or worldly wisdom, by breaking
down her ideal of life, and especially her ideal of the possible
partner of her future life. Tennyson speaks of one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
form of this, in addressing the vain coquette as the possible
future mother:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a little hoard of maxims, preaching down a daughter's heart.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Men often speak of the pain it is to them to see the debasement
of woman, because she represents to them an
ideal of good, the other nobler self, for which they must
strive. Man should represent the same thing to woman.
Love should see in its object the very crown and glory of
creation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The person love to us doth fit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like manna, hath the taste of all in it.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the low social standard of morals and manners for
man has so degraded him, that the very ideal of manhood
is belittled, and the mother warns her daughter not
to expect much from her future husband; she has no
right to hope for the loyalty of Sir Philip Sydney or the
pure ideality of Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>It is a great wrong to man to demand so little from
him. All human beings from childhood upwards are
stimulated by the opinion entertained of them, and the
claims upon them for noble and high behavior. Whatever
your own experience, do not thrust the poison of
doubt and unbelief in goodness into a daughter's mind.
Let her keep her faith and her romance, and look for a hero
to win her young heart. True, it is hard to see a Thad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>deus
of Warsaw with a cigar in his mouth, or to imagine
Hamlet with a blue veil about his hat, but nevertheless
the race of heroes is not extinct, and the girl had better
preserve her faith and her love till the true knight appears,
than accept the dreary belief that all men are alike
unworthy, and that she must not ask for a purity and
truth which exist only in the dreams of romance. Man's
low idea of woman has reacted upon him; her elevation
will restore him to his true dignity, as equally entitled to
spiritual and moral elevation of soul and refinement of
manners with herself. It is as demoralizing to young
women to hold men in contempt, as it is for young men
to have a low idea of women. &ldquo;In honor preferring one
another&rdquo; is the true condition of love, and no one has
truly loved who has not exalted the beloved far above
one's self.</p>

<p>But, after all that I have said, perhaps at too great
length, I come back to my original thought of the grand
art of education as of life. Do not dwell upon petty details
or exaggerate accidental peculiarities. Lay your
foundations broad and deep in the common ground of
humanity. Base your calculations on the sure ground
of universal law. Then, gradually, out of this common
earth will grow up the special flower, true to its own individual
law, which is just as sacred and unalterable as
the general law. All the art of the gardener cannot
transform the oak to a willow, or produce the blue dahlia,
though by its aid the sour crab has become a mellow
apple, and the astringent pear, the luscious Bartlett. We
need to study the great subject of education more, and
to talk less about the special peculiarities of woman's
education, and we shall find that the greater includes the
less, and that the more thoroughly we develop all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
powers of mind, the more eminently will each woman be
fitted to perform her own peculiar work in life.</p>

<p>I did once see a man crippled of both legs, who claimed
to be specially able to manage a washing-machine because
he stood lower than other men. I honored his
acceptance of his limitation, but still think the ordinary
complement of legs an advantage not to be despised.</p>

<p>The great duty of the educator is to place his wheel
so that the stream will fill its buckets evenly. Far
more than you can do directly for your daughter, will
the great social forces, the influences of custom, society,
hereditary tendencies do for her; but you can
hold the helm and keep the rudder firmly fixed towards
the pole-star of truth and right; and so, from all these
forces thus combined, and from the overflowing fullness
of a mother's love, always warming and kindling the
spirit of life, however much you may err in details, on
the grand basis of humanity, and in the consummate
perfection of her own individuality you may rear</p>

of girls, simply because I was not writing on that subject, but
I do not wish to be suspected of undervaluing it. By the beautiful
law of relation between the sexes, a father may often have a
finer understanding of his daughter on some points, than the mother,
and one of the great needs of our home life seems to me to be the
more intimate acquaintance and influence of the father.</div>

strange fact, but it is one, nevertheless, that the nearest family tie
does not always lead to perfect freedom and confidence, and a wise
stranger can often give the help that even a mother cannot. The
physician should here be, not the <i>mediciner</i> to disease alone, but the
guardian of health; and the wise woman who has her own experience
to guide her, as well as the learning of the schools, can speak with
an authority which will be respected when that of the mother fails.
Quite as often, perhaps, she will have to shield the daughter from

when an Indisposition is experienced to keep the mind fixed upon
the subject, and the thoughts wander from it unless coerced by the
will, the mental activity loses its spontaneous or automatic character,
and more exertion is required to maintain it volitionally during
a brief period; and more fatigue is subsequently experienced from
such an effort than would be involved in the continuance of an automatic
operation through a period many times as long. Hence he
has found it practically the greatest economy of mental labor to work
vigorously when he is disposed to do so, and to refrain from exertion,
so far as possible, <i>when it is felt to be an exertion.</i>&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Of course, this rule is not applicable to all individuals; for there
are some who would pass their whole time in listless inactivity, if
not actually spurred on by the feeling of necessity; but it holds good
for those who are sufficiently attracted by objects of interest before
them, or who have in their worldly circumstances a sufficiently strong
motive to exertion to make them feel they must work&mdash;the question
with them being, <i>how</i> they can attain their desired results with the

exemplified the very truth I have been seeking to enforce. Full of
courage and zeal, she withstood all the prejudices of her birth
and surroundings, freed her own slaves, and then devoted herself
with voice and pen to the Anti-Slavery cause, to the enfranchisement
of woman, and to every good word and work that she could
aid. Her high literary attainments, as well as her earnest purpose,
gave her great power of thought and expression, and she was the
wise counselor of many of the foremost men and women among the
reformers of the day. As her brother-in-law, himself a noble man
of high culture, stood by her coffin, with eyes filled with tears,
these were the words of his eulogium upon this woman of dauntless
courage, firm purpose, and tender heart: &ldquo;For this dear saint and

life which could receive such a tribute from such a man. Has
such a woman missed the crown and glory of womanhood?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p></div>

<span class="i0">Is but the law of service.&rdquo;&mdash;FESTUS.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I rejoice in the decline of the old brutal and tyrannical system
of teaching, which, however, did succeed in enforcing habits of application,
but the new system, as it seems to me, is training up a
race of men who will be incapable of doing anything which is disagreeable

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Other Side.</span></h2>

<p>&ldquo;This is a hard world,&rdquo; said a morbid girl of fourteen
some forty years ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered cheerfully the well-known apostle
to whom she spoke, &ldquo;and God meant it should be a hard
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When later he himself was caught up into heaven in a
chariot of fire, the serene face showed how gladly he had
accepted this &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; as his Father's will.</p>

<p>It is not so with the greater number of the world's
workers to-day. James Mill, to whom we are indebted
for some of the very best intellectual work, thought life
was not worth having, and was so devoid of spiritual
perception that he could get no glimpse of a God in a
&ldquo;world full of sin and misery.&rdquo; This proves nothing
as to the universe. It only shows how unhappily one
great man has missed the music of the spheres, and failed
to catch the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of God's work.</p>

<p>For mother and child, for teacher and pupil, the first
essential point is to accept this fact. Only so, can the
sweet order of a divine life be brought out of the chaotic
elements stirring in every soul.</p>

<p>The mother, who holds the month-old infant at her
breast, and gently imprisons the tiny fingers that would
tear her laces, or disorder her hair, takes the first step
towards the development of moral consciousness. Let
her repeat again and again that gentle restraint, and by-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>and-by
wide open eyes will ask her why, and when it is
once understood that food can be had only while the
little fingers are quiet, the first foundations of obedience are
laid. So far most mothers go, for their own comfort's
sake. If they had but the resolution to go still farther,
for the sake of the child's life-long content! No child
respects the teacher who does not <i>control</i>. All the modern
methods&mdash;including lavish gifts and the gilding of all
bitter pills&mdash;fail absolutely before the clearsightedness of
youth. If we older people know how to rise to the occasion
and thank those who demand the best of us, still
more certainly is this to be expected of the young and
the fresh-hearted; but if it were not, our duty remains
the same.</p>

<p>So much discipline as shall preserve order, develop respect,
and make possible such opportunities as the young
soul needs, is the first point. It is idle to ask how this
is to be secured. No two children can be managed alike,
and it is the variety of her tasks which consoles the
mother for her daily fatigue, and inspires her for the encounter.</p>

<p>Until the child is taught deference, it is idle to teach
it Latin; until it sees the necessity of self-control, and
the beauty of self-denial, grammar and mathematics are
to be dispensed with. In one word, the foundation of
all true development lies in preserving the natural relation
of parent and child. Whatever turns the child into
a tyrant and the mother into a slave, degrades the ideal
of both, and makes any true progress impossible. To do
what is difficult and disagreeable with a faithful and
cheerful spirit, is the first great achievement, remembering,
nevertheless, that God is a loving Father, not a hard
Master.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, loving as he is, his laws are inexorable. The
baby stumbles, and bruised limbs or swollen lips warn
it against the second careless step. Young and tender as
it is, severity encircles it on every hand. Is it possible
that we are no longer &ldquo;perfect even as he is perfect&rdquo; in
this regard?</p>

<p>But let us suppose this point gained, a foundation laid,
what obstacles lie in the way of the teacher of to-day?
The conscientious and well-meant answer to this question,
from the majority of persons is, the health of the
pupils. Worst of all, this answer comes from the physicians.</p>

<p>We are often told that the health of women now is
not as good as it was generations ago, and this has been
repeated and repeated until everybody believes it.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I was walking through Broad street
in company with John Collins Warren, when I alluded
hastily to a severe attack of croup from which my little
boy was suffering, and said, impatiently, that it seemed
as if all my care might secure for him as happy a babyhood
as that of the little things whose frozen heels were
at that moment hitting the curbstone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not ask how many of these children die,&rdquo;
replied my friend, &ldquo;and if your boy had been born down
here, he would not have lived six months.&rdquo; We are apt
to ignore the large class of existing facts of this same
kind.</p>

<p>Civilization has done so much for human health that
the invalids who once died, survive; nay, they do more,
they marry, and bring into the world other invalids, who
need special care; and, whereas, in the old time, out of a
family of twelve, five or six would die in infancy with a
persistency worthy of a better cause, the whole twelve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
would be saved by modern science; and not only that,
but enter into the statistics which are intended to show
how much worse off we are now than the typical men
and women of the past.</p>

<p>A few years ago I watched beside the death-bed of a
woman who was the only child of an only child of an
only child. I mean that for three generations the mother
had died of consumption after the birth of her first-born,
and in the first instance was herself the sole survivor of
a large family. When my friend was born, it was said at
first that she could not live, but her father was a physician,
and his care in the first place, and removal from a
country to a city life in the second, conquered fate.</p>

<p>She did live, she married, and became the mother of
ten healthy children, all of whom survive, and died herself
at the ripe age of seventy-three.</p>

<p>It is difficult to write upon this subject, because there
are no proper statistics. During the seventy-five years
that succeeded the settlement of New England, the record
of deaths was very imperfectly kept in many places, but
no one who gives much time to genealogical research can
fail to be impressed with the short lives of the women,
and the large number of children who died at birth or
soon after.</p>

<p>In those days, the &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; was the
rule, and if that survivor happened to live to a good old
age, no one inquired about those who did not.</p>

<p>I allude to these facts, as I have done before, not because
I think them of much importance, but because it is
desirable to set them against the equally undigested facts
of general invalidism which have been so persistently
pressed of late.</p>

<p>I do not believe in this general invalidism, so far as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
concerns women especially. I believe that in no country,
in any age, was life ever so reckless, and so carelessly dissipated
as it is in America to-day. In Sybaris itself, in
Corinth, and in Paris, only a few wealthy people could
indulge in the irregular lives which the unexampled
prosperity of this country opens to the great bulk of the
population.</p>

<p>I am amazed when I see it stated that &ldquo;length of
time cannot transform the sturdy German fr&auml;ulein into
the fragile American girl.&rdquo; The influence of climate does
this in one generation for our Irish and German population.
Standing in the mills at Lawrence, the pale faces
and constant cough of the operatives will attest these
words to any competent observer. During the past
three years I have parted with three satisfactory Irish
servants, who were in the incipient stages of consumption.
I dismissed them because no influence of mine could persuade
them to retire early, wear waterproof shoes, or
thick and warm clothing.</p>

<p>In a singular preface to the fifth edition of a work which
has lately occupied the public mind the author says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a remission or intermission is necessary, the
parent must decide what part of education shall be
remitted or omitted, the walk, the ball, the school, or all
of these.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No one can doubt which will interfere
most with Nature's laws, four hours' dancing or four
hours' studying.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In these pages the relation of sex to
mature life is not discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is necessary to state at the outset, that this preface
does not in the least represent the book as it naturally
strikes the reader. Women may read carelessly, as they
have been accused of doing in this instance, but when
hundreds of women, writing from all parts of the country,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in private and in public, and without concert with each
other, all testify to the same impression received, it is
impossible that the carelessness of numbers should always
feel the same bias.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that four hours of dancing is far
more injurious to a delicate girl than four hours of steady
study: why, then, in considering the education of girls,
does the author steadily avoid all cases where dancing,
late hours, and bad food, have been known to interfere
with health?</p>

<p>What satisfaction can any girl find in the fact, that the
period of mature life is not covered by the statements in
this volume? The period of a working life is included
in the years between fourteen and nineteen, and as matters
now are, society life is nearly ended at twenty. If the
beginning of brain-work were deferred till a girl were
jaded with dissipation, how much could be accomplished
in season for self-support? Schools vary in varying localities,
and since women are hereafter to be elected on
every school committee, it is reasonable to suppose that
unwise pressure from that source will soon cease.</p>

<p>All figures of speech are misleading, but it is quite fair
to meet the statement that we must not train oaks and
anemones in the same way, by retorting that that is precisely
what God does.</p>

<p>He gives to different plants different powers of appropriation,
sets them in precisely the same circumstances,
and leaves them.</p>

<p>The sturdy oak, that centuries of storm have beaten
into firmness, which fits it to encounter the fiercest blows
of the wave; the stately pine, which is to tower as main-mast
when the gale is at its height, stand serried or single
on the mountain's peak. At their feet nestles the wind-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>flower,
quite as confident of its destiny, although no sun
is moderated, no shower abated for its tender sake. It
is protected by the very way in which it is made,
by its very loneliness, pregnant as that is with the
charm of sweetness and color. So might it be with
woman!</p>

<p>Private schools in our large cities cannot be said to
overwork their pupils. Fifty years ago, when my mother
was educated, far more was required of girls at school
than was ever possible in my day. Thirty years ago, when
my school education ended, far more was possible to me
than has ever been required of my daughter. It is the
uniform testimony of teachers, that girls now study less,
that the hours of recitation are fewer, and that dilatoriness
and absences are far more frequently excused than
was once the case.</p>

<p>At the most fashionable, and also the best conducted
school in Boston fifty years ago, my mother was allowed
no study time in school, and committed thirty pages of
history as a daily lesson. For myself, at a time when we
were pursuing languages and the higher mathematics,
we took a whole canto of Dante three times a week,
and were required to give an explanation of every historical
allusion. I had no study time in school; but
neither my mother, nor myself, nor any girls in my class,
were in the least injured by anything required of us.
During the whole of our school life, we &ldquo;thought and
understood&rdquo; as children, and very reluctant we were to
&ldquo;put away childish things.&rdquo; We rose for a bath and
walk before a seven o'clock breakfast, nine o'clock found
us at school, and we returned to a two o'clock dinner.
In the afternoon we walked, or rode on horseback, or
studied together for an hour. We took tea at six or half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
past six o'clock, and the curfew ringing at nine found us
preparing for bed. We had no time for unsuitable
reading, and none of the cares or dissipations of maidenhood
perplexed our straight forward way.</p>

<p>If we could secure this simplicity for our children, we
should have small reason to be anxious about their
health.</p>

<p>What, then, are the drawbacks to a teacher's efforts to-day?
If girls are not studying too hard and too much,
what are they doing which stands in the way of a true
education, taking the word in the broadest sense?</p>

<p>The teacher's first obstacle lies in the superficial character
of the American mind. We have scarcely one in the
country capable of being a hard student. The whole
nation repels the idea of drudgery of any sort, and the
most conscientious teacher has to contend against a home
influence, which, working at right angles with her own,
hardly allows any noble effort.</p>

<p>Next to this is inherited tendency: from fathers fevered
with restless mercantile speculation, or tossed between
&ldquo;bulls and bears&rdquo; in Wall street, or who allow
themselves to indulge in practices which their daughters
are supposed never to know, girls inherit an &ldquo;abnormal
development of the nervous system,&rdquo; and every fibre in
their bodies feels the &ldquo;twist in the nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From mothers of large families, overworn with house-work
themselves, or, still worse, fretted by the impossibility
of keeping a home comfortable, aided only by unwilling
and half-trained servants, girls inherit a depressed
and morbid tendency to call life &ldquo;hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spirit of the age is also against them. They
do not have the help which comes from a trusting
religious spirit. The &ldquo;Conflict of the Ages&rdquo; has pene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>trated
to the heart of almost every household, and care is
too seldom taken to save that love of God and trust in
his Fatherly care, upon which the comfort and happiness
of the young so much depend. It seems to me that
very few parents realize this. If a girl has a loving
mother, it is not enough. She needs, still farther, the
consciousness of that sustaining Power which holds both
her and the universe in its embrace. If she has not a
loving mother, how can she endure life without this
support?</p>

<p>But let us suppose that the teacher has met and
vanquished these difficulties&mdash;she has enemies still at
hand that our ancestors never knew. The girls whom she
teaches live in high houses, piled storey upon storey, so
that three or four flights of stairs come between them
and the open air&mdash;between them and healthful play.
The crowd of people who go annually to Europe, and
bring home its follies instead of its charms, have succeeded
in changing our simple midday meal into a dinner
of many courses, eaten under the gaslight. At this meal
the young girl finds food very different from the roast
mutton, and bread and butter eaten daily by her English
sister at the same age. She has tea and coffee at other
meals, and probably a glass of wine at this, especially if
she is thought to be studying hard. In the afternoon,
she has no longer simple, happy life in the open air.
Although her ear be so deficient that she may hammer
all the afternoon over an exercise that she will not
recognize when she hears it well played at a concert the
same evening, she is kept at her instrument as if all
her salvation of body and soul lay in the keys of the
piano.</p>

<p>The irritability which bad habits, bad food, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
want of fresh air develop, needs the counterpoise of a
fresh excitement&mdash;so a German, the opera, or a tragedy,
occupies her evening hours. Three or four days in the
week, at least, she is up till midnight, and rises just in
time to get to school at nine. She never stands in the
cool evening air to see the red sun sink below the hills;
she misses the holy calm of the early morning, which
falls upon a flushed and heated life as its dews fall on
the flowers. Dissipation, either mental or physical,
crowds every cranny of her life. Parents object to every
lesson out of school, so the whole period of preparation
and recitation is pressed into the school-hours. Her dress
is wholly unsuited to health; and when I say this,
I wish to be understood as saying nothing in favor of
bloomers or any other special dress. An intelligent woman
can decide for herself and her children as to what
need of change there is in her dress; and many of us
have worn for half a century clothes that were loose,
well adjusted, and healthful, without drawing attention
to any peculiarity. Nor must there be any tyrannical
dictation on this subject. Some of us prefer to rest our
clothes upon our shoulders; some of us are only comfortable
when they depend upon the hips. It cannot be
denied that the heavily-weighted skirts now in vogue
are uncleanly and unwholesome, even when worn short;
and while school-girls elaborate, friz, powder, and puff
their hair like their elders, and trim their dresses to
such excess, it will be impossible for them to find time
for consecutive study. Every separate curl, lace, or fold,
becomes a separate cause of worry; and &ldquo;worry&rdquo; lies at
the bottom of American degeneracy, male and female.</p>

<p>Every heart in this country came to a sudden pause
the other day, when the name of Agassiz was moaned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
out by the funeral-bells of Cambridge. Who ever worked
harder than he? &ldquo;Without haste, yet without rest,&rdquo;
his summer's recreation became the hardest work of the
world; but in his life an ever-flowing cheerfulness, and
a genial welcome for any honest soul, showed the healthfulness
of his busy walk. If anything shortened his
three-score and ten years, it was the care and anxiety
which insufficient appropriation and political indifference
or chicanery crowded into his later life.</p>

<p>The scholar, young or old, must keep a calm and well-poised
mind. Let our mothers consider whether this is
possible to children upon whom the follies of mature life
are crowded in infancy.</p>

<p>If in idle moments the children of this generation
take up a book, it is no longer a simple Bible story, or
a calm classic of the English tongue, but the novels of
Miss Braddon, Mrs. Southworth, or Mrs. Wood wake
them into a premature life of the imagination and the
senses. Before they are six years old they hold weddings
for their dolls, enact love scenes in their tableaux,
or go to theatrical exhibitions as stimulating as the
&ldquo;Black Crook,&rdquo; if less offensive to the taste. The skating
parties and gymnastics are also fruitful sources of
ill-health. The girl prepares herself for the former by
inflating and over-heating her skirts over the register in
the hall-floor; a few minutes' exercise chills the hot
drapery&mdash;what wonder that a morbid bodily sensitiveness
follows the insane exposure? No thoughtful person can
watch a class of gymnasts, without seeing how extreme
and unnatural are many of the attitudes assumed, especially
for women. What would be thought of making
bread or sweeping floors, if these compelled such attitudes,
or brought about such fatigue?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The sleep of these exhausted pupils is often broken,
by what has been wittily called a &ldquo;panorama on the
brain,&rdquo; in which the worries, excitements, dissipations of
the day, are incessantly repeated, and they rise late,
more wearied than they went to bed.</p>

<p>In spite of eminent authority to the contrary, mothers
observe that it is their sons who require the largest
allowance of sleep, and who keep the morning meal waiting;
but if the growing girl cannot sleep, she should be
compelled to lie in bed the proper number of hours, and
it is obvious, that sleep like that I have described is no
refreshment, and furnishes no opportunity for repair of
tissue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to borrow a book, doctor,&rdquo; said a patient the
other day to a famous specialist. &ldquo;Any book upon my
shelves, madam,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;except those which
concern the diseases of women,&rdquo; and the lady turned disappointed
away.</p>

<p>It behooves all those who have the care of children of
both sexes, to bear their possible futures silently in mind;
but all talk to them, or before them, all reading upon
physiological subjects, during the period of development,
should be forbidden, for the reasons that dictated the
answer of the specialist; children should be instructed
long before the developing period. I cannot tell what
might be possible if we had to deal with girls in a normal
state of health; but the girls and women of to-day
are encouraged to a morbid consciousness of sex; and I
believe, that all that relates to personal care should be
ordered by those who are the natural guardians of the
young, without unnecessary explanation or caution.
When development begins, special treatment is required;
not according to the sex so much as according to the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>dividual;
and no parent or teacher can dictate to another
on general grounds. That school or family is an
absolute failure which does not allow a margin large
enough and loose enough for all possible contingencies,
as regards boys or girls.</p>

<p>If any one thinks the picture of youthful life which I
have drawn an exaggerated one, let him read the books
commonly published, descriptive of child-life, and once
convinced, he will not wonder that the &ldquo;number of invalid
girls is such as to excite the gravest alarm.&rdquo; From
all the cares imposed by dress, and from much of the weakness
deduced from furnaces and high-storeyed houses,
boys are exempted by their habits and general custom.
If it is thought by any one that the boys of to-day are
stronger than the girls, let them be subjected to the same
regimen, and the result fairly reported. Let their steps
be clogged by skirts, embroidered or plaited into death
warrants; let them be kept at the piano or running up
and down stairs when they should be in bed or at play;
let them read sentimental novels or worse, and hang over
the furnaces, instead of frolicking in the open air. We
shall understand better, when this experiment is once
tried, that God makes boy and girl alike healthy; but
that social folly has, from the very first, set the girl at a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>Do sisters &ldquo;imitate brothers in persistent work everywhere?&rdquo;
Nay, it is not the brothers whom they imitate,
but their own steadfast, God-implanted instincts, which
they thus attempt to work out. Girls cannot do two
things well at a time. Then let them resign the life of
fashion, excitement and folly, and give themselves to
study, fresh air and an obedient life in a well-disciplined
home. Every teacher of to-day will tell them, that those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
girls who go most regularly to school are healthier than
those who lead desultory lives, and that among the students
of any one school or college, the healthiest are
generally those who work the hardest.</p>

<p>This is as true of boys as of girls. It is not the &ldquo;honor
man&rdquo; who breaks down at college, but he who leads an
irregular and idle life. It is true, for the very simple
reason, that hard study is incompatible for any length of
time, or in other than very exceptional cases, with luxurious
habits, over-eating or drinking, late hours, or
excessive dissipation.</p>

<p>In this recent work it has been stated, that all schools
are adjusted to meet the requirements of men; and in
quoting a case which was wholly imaginary, so far as its
supposed connection with Vassar College was concerned,
the author goes on to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pupil's account of her regimen there, was so
nearly that of a boy's regimen, that it would puzzle a
physiologist to determine from that alone, whether the
subject of it were male or female.&rdquo; Of course, these
words are intended to express disapprobation, and carry
a doubt as to the fitness of Vassar College to educate
girls. Nothing could be more unjust or preposterous
than the conclusions likely to be deduced from this
statement.</p>

<p>We are told that from fourteen to nineteen, no girl
must be encouraged to persistent effort in study, or anything
else. Now, the laws of life are absolute, and if
proper habits of study have not been formed by the age
of nineteen, they never can be formed in this life; the
girl who gives only an intermittent attention to study up
to her twentieth year, is prevented by all the influences
about her from &ldquo;intermitting&rdquo; the press of her social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
duties, so I will not deny that it was the happiest surprise
of my life when the first four years of Vassar College
showed me that there were still hundreds of girls
willing to come to Poughkeepsie, after they were
eighteen years old, and shut themselves out of the world
for four years, abandoning gayeties of all sorts, the German,
the opera, and the parade, that they might fit themselves
for the duties of their future life.</p>

<p>The debt of this country to Matthew Vassar's memory
can hardly be exaggerated. In eight years of steady
work, the college has contrived to exert an influence
that is felt in all parts of the United States and of
Canada. This is an educational influence in the broadest
sense; it pertains to dress, habits, manners, regularity
of life, and sleep; the proper preparation and
serving of food, physical exercise, physiological care, safe
and healthful study, and the highest womanly standards
in all respects.</p>

<p>The college has received delicate pupils, whom she has
sent out four years after, strong and well; and it is the
rule, that the health of the classes steadily improves from
the Freshman to the Senior year.</p>

<p>Vassar has been fortunate in retaining its resident
physician throughout the whole eight years of its existence,
and if the Faculty were to grow careless, the parents,
educated by what she has been accustomed to give,
would demand the care that their children need.</p>

<p>The pupils of Vassar belong to no special class in society,
and are drawn from varied localities. When the
college opened, she had upon her Faculty three women
whose peers it would be hard to find, for excellence of
character, refinement of feeling, delicacy of manner, attainment
in science, and a quiet elegance of dress. Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
these, one is now gathered to a wider sphere of usefulness,
so we speak of Hannah Lyman by name, as a
woman whose equal most of the students would never
have seen, if good fortune had not taken them to Vassar.
The first pupils of Vassar were thoughtful women, who
had been long prepared for its expected opening. They
appreciated at once the lofty influence of these examples,
and the reverent respect they always showed was impressed
upon every succeeding class. These teachers
were in every detail of their lives, what intelligent,
modest, and cultivated women should be.</p>

<p>As to dress, so far as example and counsel could do it,
the pupils were taught simplicity.</p>

<p>As to habits, they were taught regularity, order, cleanliness,
and the self-denial in small matters which would
prevent then from annoying one another.</p>

<p>As to manners, the courtesy shown by so finished a
gentlewoman as Miss Lyman, not only in all her intercourse
with the Faculty and the teachers, but to the
pupils, in all the minute details of official and social
intercourse, took effect, as no lessons born of foreign
travel or intercourse with the world could ever have
done. It was courtesy growing out of character and conscience;
it was not the mere dictation of custom.</p>

<p>To live with such regularity as Vassar enforced for
four years, made it almost certain that these pupils would
never fail of that divine blessing for the rest of their
lives. Their meals were served at the minute, their
rising and retiring were at the proper hours, and sleep
was as secure as good health, cheerful minds, and moderate
excitement could make it.</p>

<p>Their food was of the best material, of good variety,
and most careful preparation. It is not too much to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
that none of the girls could ever have seen in their own
homes such perfect bread and butter, so abundant milk
and meat, or simple delicacies so carefully served without
interruption for four years.</p>

<p>Their exercise was watched by the resident physician,
and every flagging step or indifferent recitation was supposed
to have two possible bearings, one upon the goodwill
of the student, the other upon some incipient physical
derangement.</p>

<p>Their study hours were carefully regulated by teachers
who knew what girls could properly accomplish, and
when a question arose it was decided in the only proper
way&mdash;practically. I was present once when a pupil
complained to Hannah Lyman of the impossibility of
preparing a lesson in arithmetic in the prescribed time.
That night Miss Lyman sat late over her own slate,
and by going slowly through every process required
of the pupil, justified the complaint and corrected the
error.</p>

<p>In all table manners and social life, the girls at Vassar
had the highest standard constantly before them, and
when they went out into the world at the end of four
years, they carried into their varied homes wholly new
ideas about dress, food, proprieties, and life.</p>

<p>The conditions of a girl's successful growth, we are
told, are to be found in&mdash;</p>

<ol><li>Abundant and wholesome food.</li>
<li>Care in all relating to her health.</li>
<li>Work so apportioned as to leave room for growth,
beyond the mere repair of tissue, and&mdash;</li>
<li>Sleep.</li></ol>

<p>In no homes that I know in America, are all these
points so completely secured as at Vassar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Every year, about one hundred girls leave this institution,
to take their positions in life. Some of them are
to be teachers, some mothers, some housekeepers for
father or brother, but they will not go to either of
these lives, ignorant of that upon which family comfort
depends.</p>

<p>Never again will they be content with sour bread or a
soiled table-cloth; never again will they mistake arrogant
self-assertion for good-breeding, or a dull, half-furnished
&ldquo;living-room&rdquo; for a cheerful parlor. They have all been
taught the virtue which lies in mother earth, and the
fragrance she gives to her flowers; they know the health
and power given by the labor of their hands and the use
of their feet. Fortunately, the girls at Vassar come under
few of the precautions required for growing girls<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
but of those who are younger, it may be said that the
impending maidenhood sometimes makes such heavy
draughts upon the circulation, that a girl's real safety is
found in steady study or persistent manual labor; the
diversion of blood to brain or muscles relieving the more
sensitive growing organs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have longed to put my word into this discussion,&rdquo;
wrote an experienced teacher to me from the city of
Portland the other day, &ldquo;for I hold that hysterics are
born of silly mothers and fashionable follies, and I find
them easily cured by equal doses of ridicule and arithmetic.&rdquo;
The 'arithmetic,' or other severe study that corrects
or prevents morbid notions, that diverts a girl's
thoughts from herself; her functions, and her future, is
in most cases the best medicine.</p>

<p>Of this developing period of life it may be even more
safely said than of any other, that &ldquo;constant employment
is constant enjoyment,&rdquo; and this employment, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
steady, must be varied, so as to shift the effort from one
set of powers or muscles to another.</p>

<p>I am not one of those who believe that girls require
more care than boys through this period, if the laws of
life are properly observed in both cases; and I think
that when women and mothers come to utter words of
the same scientific weight on this subject, their testimony
will differ entirely from that of the leading physicians
who now hold the public ear.</p>

<p>It is claimed that man is made for sustained, and
woman for periodic effort. It is by no means certain
that this is so, and if it be indeed a law of organization,
then it must be a law which will dominate the whole life.
It will not only keep a girl back from mastering her tools
until the time for using them is passed, but it will interfere
with her steady use of them through her whole life,
shut her out from the markets of the world, and unfit her
for all steady, consecutive duty, either public or private.</p>

<p>Let no girl be deterred from steady and faithful work
in the vain fear that she will unsex herself, and to a loving
mother's needful anxieties let not this superfluous care
be added. True, we may all make mistakes as to what
is desirable, needful, or possible, but to the humble seeker
after the right way, a clear sight will always come, and to
the preposterous cautions, born of a morbid and unwise
interference with the courses of life, I oppose these words
quoted from that &ldquo;physiology of Moses,&rdquo; which it is said
that we have not outgrown: &ldquo;Ye shall not offer unto the
Lord that which is bruised or crushed or broken or
cut;&rdquo; these words are true, whether spoken of a dove's
feathers or a girl's soul; or the still later and wiser words,
&ldquo;Take, therefore, no thought for the morrow, for the
morrow shall take thought for the things of itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>.&rdquo;
The foundations of true manhood and true womanhood
are fortunately laid too deep for our meddling. It is
true that we may destroy the perfume of life, for men
and women, by mistaken efforts and perverse guidance,
but the fruit of our error is not immortal, and it is never
too late to retrieve our false steps.</p>

<p>So far from losing what is best in either sex, as we
advance in life, we may be sure that increasing years will
find it intensified; that so long as men and women live,
they may, if they desire, they <i>must</i>, if they are faithful,
grow more manly and more womanly. If they draw
nearer to each other, as they sit hand in hand looking
towards the sunset, it is only because they are both heirs
of the immortal, seeking and gaining the same end.</p>

<p>It is impossible to dismiss these considerations without
touching afresh the subject of co-education. But we
need not rest upon the family fact or the old common
school system.</p>

<p>Oberlin was the pioneer in the system of co-education,
a system into which she was forced, not so much by
fanatical theories as by the cruel hand of poverty. For
forty-one years she has held up her banner in the wilderness,
and in 1868 I found her with nearly twelve hundred
pupils. It was very largely to her men and women that
the country owed its safety in the last war. As governors
of States, generals of armies, and mothers of families, or
teachers of schools, they kept the nation to its duty.
From this beginning twenty-five colleges had sprung in
1868. It is nothing to the argument that these colleges
may not present as high a standard of classical attainment
as Harvard or Yale, if that should turn out to be
the fact. For more than thirty years a large number of
them have been proving the possibility of co-education,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and their graduates are not the unhappy childless women
of Massachusetts, but the happy and healthy women of
the West, who are strong in proportion as they are busy,
and whose &ldquo;children are plenty as blackberries.&rdquo; Beside
these twenty-five colleges, Antioch has been working
steadily for twenty-four years, and in addition to the
small institutions scattered all through New York and
the Middle States, Cornell has lately opened her doors
to the same system. All those who have practical experience
of its results know how much wiser, sweeter,
and more serene is the life that is shaped by its
methods.</p>

<p>It is a subject on which argument is alike useless and
undesirable. We must observe and be guided by the
practical result.</p>

<p>We are told that public duties are more exacting than
private. No woman will be found to believe it. It may
be often difficult to estimate the heavy stake that underlies
the small duty.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A man must labor till set of sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a woman's work is never done;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and while this distich hints at the truth, it is certain that
private life will continue to make upon her as heavy demands
as the human constitution will bear. For every
reason then, a healthy mind in a healthy body is the first
thing to be sought. It is to be borne in mind that the first
thing Nature sets us to do, is committing to memory&mdash;and
experience will show that this is the natural first function
of the young scholar. Three languages can be better
learned under eight years of age, than the simplest lessons
in grammar, arithmetic, or history&mdash;unless these are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
confined to rules, tables, or dates, which may be most
profitably committed, exactly as &ldquo;Mother Goose&rdquo; is. I
take pains to allude to this, because I think great
harm has been done of late by the axiom that a
child should not learn anything but what it understands.</p>

<p>This is not true of any of us, young or old. We
must learn many things before we can understand one;
and nothing is so unsuited to young brains, as prolonged
efforts to understand. Intellectual processes differ after
we become old enough to understand; not only in the
two sexes, but in every two individuals. Of this fact
we must take heed, or all comfort will be destroyed and
much unnecessary work done.</p>

<p>How then are we to lay the foundations of a sincere
education? We must begin with the religious, the
moral, and the emotional nature. We must sustain the
relations God imposes on parent and child.</p>

<p>We must bring the child face to face with the fact
that this is a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; world. By that I mean, a world
in which difficulties are to be fairly met&mdash;not shirked,
set aside, or &ldquo;got round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To help her to endure this hardness to the end, she
must be taught a simple trust in God, and an obedient
but by no means slavish deference towards parents, teachers,
and elders.</p>

<p>Without this trust and this obedience, every child leads
an unhappy and unnatural life; and their existence may
be made sure without one word of dogmatic teaching.
Having given to the well-poised mind these inward
helps, which all true growth requires, we must secure
simple food, easy dress, regular meals, and the proper
quantity of sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The child is then prepared for the steady work of
mind and body which will develop both.</p>

<p>While we do everything to make knowledge attractive
and to stimulate thought when the time for thought
arrives, we must be careful never to yield to the superficial
demands of our people. The Kindergarten, which
is refreshment and help to the plodding German child,
may become a snare to the light-minded American.</p>

<p>When the period of development arrives, study should
be carefully watched to make sure there is no overwork;
the character of the reading and the lessons should be
guided, so that neither may tend to excite a precocious
development of the passions or the senses.</p>

<p>Anatomy may be profitably studied at this period;
but just as the specialist turned his patient away from
his loaded shelves, lest her own maladies should be increased
by a morbid study of their source, I would keep
developing girls and boys from a careful study of their
own functions.</p>

<p>If they are trained to quiet obedience, they will grow
up in health precisely in proportion to the skill with
which their thoughts are diverted from themselves to
subjects of wider interest and more entertaining suggestion.</p>

<p>In conclusion I must say, that education is to be
adapted neither to boys nor to girls, but to individuals.</p>

<p>The mother, or the teacher, has learned little who attempts
to train any two children alike, whether as regards
the books they are to study, the time it is to take,
the attitudes they are to assume, or the amusements they
are to be allowed.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Effects of Mental Growth</span></h2>

<p>A few years since, when Mr. Higginson's essay &ldquo;Ought
Women to learn the Alphabet?&rdquo; first appeared in the
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and I was reading some of its keen
sarcasms to a gentleman just returned from a tour of
Eastern travel, he related a bit of his recent experience
in the old city of Sychar, in Samaria. There was pointed
out to him as an object of great interest and attention, a
remarkable girl. She was the theme of animated discussion
throughout all the neighborhood of Ebal and
Gerizim&mdash;the observed of all observers, when she appeared
on the street, or went with the maidens of Sychar
to draw water from Jacob's well, still the glory of their
city. This little maiden's distinction was that she was
the first girl in that old city, who, during a period of nine
hundred years, had transcended the allotted sphere of
woman in so bold a step as that of going to school and
learning to read. There had been no special purpose in
the act. She had been attracted by the mysterious
sounds from the room where boys were taking their first
lessons in Talmudic law and lore, and had gratified her
curiosity by learning what they meant. &ldquo;It whistled
itself,&rdquo; averred the little school-boy, apologetically, under
fear of the rod; so she, another <i>it</i>, learned itself.</p>

<p>It was not until the steps of other little maidens were also
tending towards school, that the gravity of her transgres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>sion,
and the danger of the innovation, were at all comprehended.
Then there was indeed an excitement among the
orthodox Samaritans. In the opinion of the staunch appellants
to the Law and the Prophets, she had transcended
the limitations of her sex, and the marital claim. &ldquo;My
wife is my shoe&rdquo; was ominously threatened. Sychar
had not been so roused for ages. The scribes and
prophets waited in expectancy to see fire from heaven
descend upon a city where such things had been suffered,
or to see the young transgressor transformed, by the
judgments of heaven, out of the proper semblance of
womanhood. But when she appeared in the streets, with
her sister maidens, performed her appointed tasks in rank
and file with them, talked and chatted as heretofore&mdash;though
perhaps gossiped less&mdash;and bore her pitcher as
deftly on her head as ever, the matter began to die away,
and she was only pointed out as the one who had <i>first</i>
sinned. True, the High Priest shook his head and prophesied
&ldquo;The end is not yet.&rdquo; But the fire had caught,
and, according to the laws of fire, physical or Promethean,
it spread, until between the mountains of blessing and
cursing, a dozen Samaritan girls had learned the alphabet.</p>

<p>How far education has advanced in Sychar, what has
been its effects upon the health of Samaritan women, or
how much it has shaken the social basis. &ldquo;My wife is
my shoe,&rdquo; I have had no very late opportunities for learning;
but, judging from the effects of learning the alphabet
in other places, I cannot doubt that this innovation,
seeing it did not precipitate the world out of its course,
has been followed by others, less startling, perhaps, but
tending the same way. Be this as it may, this initiate
of an educational revolution in Sychar has its lessons for
our times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rabbis of the old Samaritan capital saw in this
unlooked for seizure of the key of knowledge by the
hand of a woman, a second fall, and to them the world
again gave &ldquo;signs of woe that all was lost.&rdquo; This Miltonian
cry of woe to the world, through knowledge or
privilege given to woman, has been repeated in every
age by Rabbis and High Priests, who find the Eden of
life in the poet's picture of the human family, before
woman aspired to taste the fruit of the tree &ldquo;to be desired
to make one wise;&rdquo; when there was as yet no misunderstanding
of the object for which man and woman
each were made: &ldquo;He, for God only; she, for God in
him.&rdquo; That the world was a paradise while man's
wisdom sufficed for her who was to behold God only
through him, has been the teaching of creeds not yet
dead. There is a lesson in the little Samaritan maiden's
repetition of the first transgression, as well as in its
repetition a thousand times since. He that runneth may
read in it this moral of the symbol, legend, or verity of
Holy Writ, whichever way we may regard the story of
the bite of the apple, viz.: that a desire <i>to know</i> was
evidently an element in woman's original psychical
nature, be it original sin, or otherwise; and correspondingly
endowed, as is, just as evidently, her physical organization,
to gratify this desire, we may conclude that
she will compel some of the educational institutions of
the age to her service in its accomplishment.</p>

<p>I am glad that the recent alarm of Dr. Clarke, certainly
the most rousing of our time, has been sounded.
Rung out from his high tower of professional eminence
and authority, it must and does attract attention. It is a
cry of &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; and let us see where we are going. So,
rude and harsh as are many of its tones, discordant with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
truth as we can but believe some of his statements, and
more of his conclusions, I am glad it has been sounded.
His facts are momentous. Let us heed them, and charge
the sin where it belongs. The book will lead to investigations
and in the end to an improvement in methods, and
a higher, more thorough, education of women. Dr. Clarke
thinks &ldquo;that if it were possible to marry Oriental care of
woman's organization to her Western liberty and culture
of the brain, there would be a new birth, and a loftier
type of womanly grace and force.&rdquo; But his conclusions
seem to be that this is impossible, and, since they cannot
be united, of the two types of women, the brain-cultured,
intellectual women of the West, and the Oriental women,
&ldquo;with their well developed forms, their brown skins, rich
with the blood and sun of the East,&rdquo; he prefers the latter.</p>

<p>Two years since I visited some portions of the East,
where these primitive Oriental types of womanhood are
to be seen. Sometimes in the gardens of a harem, I have
seen them, sitting, lolling, gossiping life away, only careful
to guard their veiled faces from exposure, no matter
if the rest of the body were as destitute of covering as
their souls were of feeling, or their brains of thought. I
saw more frequently another class of women&mdash;those from
whom poverty had rent the veil&mdash;some still clinging to a
filthy rag, or diverting a more filthy shred from the tatters
of their garments to cover their faces, because, as a sheik
explained to me, &ldquo;cause she shame she's woman.&rdquo; Desiring
to compare the length of the life of woman,
under such conditions, with that of life which we have
been wont to call civilized and enlightened, I often inquired
the age of women whom we saw, and was surprised
at being as often assured that women whose furrowed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
wrinkled faces would indicate that they were sixty, were
not more than thirty-eight&mdash;at most, forty years old.
Most Eastern women that I saw, exemplified the &ldquo;Oriental
care of woman's organization&rdquo; by abandoning their
own to a mere animal vegetation. They had borne children
innumerable. These swarmed upon us from fissures
in the rocks, from dens, caves, and old tombs in the
mountain sides&mdash;a scrofulous, leprous progeny of wretchedness,
with a few fairer types, to which some principle
of &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; had imparted strength to rise
above the common conditions of life.</p>

<p>I had also some opportunity to see the &ldquo;Oriental organization
of woman&rdquo; under process of mental culture,
in schools something like our own. Especially anxious
to learn all that pertained to progress in education in the
old cities in the East, I sought every opportunity to visit
schools, Mahometan, Christian, and Jewish, under the
old or under the more modern <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and at the risk of
being set down as a true American inquisitor, I pressed
questions in every direction that would be likely to be
suggested to a practical teacher, studying the problem we
are here trying to solve: &ldquo;What is the best education
for our American girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The best schools that I visited are those established
within twelve or twenty years some, quite recently, by
the Prussian Protestant Sisters or Deaconesses, who have
had a rare and severe training for their work&mdash;physical,
mental, and hygienic. In these schools, also, are to be
found pupils from the better classes of the people, though
they often have an orphan department attached, into
which the neglected and wretched children are received,
kindly cared for, and educated. In the opinion of these
teachers, mental development is the source of health to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
their pupils, and they invariably spoke of the improving
health and vigor of their girls under school training.
They come, often, miserable and sickly from the neglect
or abuse of ignorant mothers. Many such were growing
healthy. The inert were growing active and playful, the deformed,
greatly improving. One teacher said that to see
the girls under her care inclined to any active play, until
they had been in school months, sometimes years, was
very rare. This inertness was more difficult to overcome
in girls from the higher than the lower classes, for, in
addition to an inert physical organization, a contempt for
labor, with which they associated all exertion whatever,
was born with them; and only through a long course of
training&mdash;not until their brains began to take in the
meaning and pleasure of study&mdash;could they throw it off;
To rouse a girl and find out what she looked forward
to in life, she had often asked her, &ldquo;And what do you
intend to <i>do</i> when you leave school?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, sit,&rdquo; had
been many times the answer she had received, &ldquo;Sit,&rdquo;
which meant, she said, to wait and get married.</p>

<p>At Beyrout I visited several very interesting schools.
The Superior or Principal of one told me she had been
associated, in her preparatory course, at Kaiserwerth,
with Florence Nightingale, for two years; and she described
to me the discipline of that institution and others,
where these teachers and nurses are trained. It is a discipline
of severe study, accompanied by nursing, watching,
hospital practice, and sometimes the hardest drudgery
of work. She had often seen, she said, &ldquo;Miss
Nightingale, a born lady, on her knees scrubbing floors.
But there was no distinction of persons in these institutions.
Those who came to them looked forward to lives,
not of ease, but useful work, and they must be prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to bear hardness as good soldiers.&rdquo; &ldquo;But Miss Nightingale
has broken down; may not the severity of this discipline
have been one cause of what she is suffering
now?&rdquo; She did not think so; they had all had a training
just as severe as hers, the sisters here, in Jerusalem,
Smyrna, and everywhere, and they were well and strong.
But there were limits to human strength and endurance;
and Miss Nightingale's work in the Crimea, performed
under such conditions as it was, had transcended what
the human organization could endure&mdash;cold, hunger,
foul air, insufficient and unwholesome food, with such
incessant work, watching, and nursing, that no human
being was proof against it. It was a miracle what Miss
Nightingale had withstood before she broke down.</p>

<p>But these sisters wear no long or heavy dresses. Their
uniform is a simple dark-blue-and-white calico dress-skirt
neither long nor very full, sleeves close, yet allowing
perfect freedom in the use of the arm, a simple white
collar and apron, and cap of shining, spotless whiteness.
Their shoes, too, are after the pattern of those which, we are
told, are always worn by Florence Nightingale&mdash;with a
sole as broad as the foot they were made for, and fitted
to the natural shape of the foot. The food, the sister
said, at Kaiserwerth, as in all the training-schools, was
&ldquo;nourishing, but very simple.&rdquo; Such facts are worth
noting. If they were accompaniments of our system of
education, I do not believe that American girls would
break down under the brain-work that any University
course for men, in our country, imposes. As to the item
of shoes, who does not know that a great deal more work,
and better, can be performed in shoes that fit, than in
such as tire the feet? And this is scarcely less true of
brain-work than house-work. I believe that the shoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
worn by young girls and young women now, are a great
cause of nervous irritability, and, joined with other causes,
may be a source of disease, &ldquo;nervous prostration,&rdquo; so
called in after life. I have heard women say many times,
&ldquo;Nothing in the world will bring a sick-headache on
so quickly as wearing a shoe that hurts my feet.&rdquo; The oft
repeated words have led me to watch my pupils in this
respect carefully, and to study shoes and their effects, as
among the evils which certainly ought not to be charged
to brain-work, <i>per se</i>, nor to our school system, in general.
It also made me take especial note of the shoes that the
Deaconess sisters wore as a part of the dress in which,
through long practice, they learned &ldquo;hardness,&rdquo; and
came out strong and healthy, but not the less accomplished,
charming women.</p>

<p>The school at Beyrout, under charge of these sisters, is
probably one of the best in all the East. I was conducted
by the lady Principal through every department. In
one room an Arabic Professor was engaged at the black-board,
instructing a class in studies pursued in that language.
In another part of the same room, young ladies
were reading to a lady-teacher an oration of Demosthenes
in classic Greek. Another class was reading critically a
portion of Milton's &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; and yet another
was engaged in preparing a French lesson. With all
these classes the lady sister spoke in the language under
study or recitation, as did the teachers of each class,
with the exception of the Greek class, in which, the sister
said, the pupils were taught to read the classic Greek,
but allowed to speak the language as now spoken, as
they had many pupils to whom this was their native
tongue; but they ought to be able to read the works of
their great men of another age. In another department<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
I heard the same sister speak most beautiful German.
This was her native tongue. Italian was also taught, and
I heard it fluently spoken. It seemed to me that their
course, though different, required nearly as much study
as ours.</p>

<p>At the hotel, where I remained ten days, I made the
acquaintance of two young ladies, of Greek and Armenian
parentage. They had been in this school for several
years and were still pursuing their studies. They spoke
half a dozen languages, English, they said, the most imperfectly
of any, but I have never seen an American girl
who spoke French or German, when she graduated, as
well as these girls spoke English, and their drill in music
was quite as severe as that of American girls. They
were taught arithmetic, but not to the extent that girls
are in our schools. Physiology was also a part of their
course. They were not so unctuously fat as many of the
entirely idle women of the harems, whose object in life
is to &ldquo;sit,&rdquo; but to us, who are wont to call that a &ldquo;well-developed
form&rdquo; which would seem to adapt its owner
to do something in life, rather than to sit an existence
through, their physiques would indicate more vigorous
health than those of the &ldquo;grave Turk's wifely crowd,&rdquo;
which Dr. Clarke wished he could marry to the &ldquo;brain-culture&rdquo;
of our women. Their faces were still &ldquo;rich
with the blood and sun of the East,&rdquo; and I should pity
the American who could find a loss in the exchange of
the &ldquo;unintelligent, sensuous faces&rdquo; of the harem drones
for the soul-light which, through brain-culture, beamed
from the eyes of these Oriental young women.</p>

<p>In this school they had advanced to an innovation
beyond anything to which the teachers had been themselves
trained in Europe&mdash;quite beyond anything in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
East, even the mission schools&mdash;the experiment of co-education,
in the primary department, where a few boys
had been admitted. Here I saw a daughter and a son of
the Pasha of Syria in the same room and in the same
class, &ldquo;And how does this system work?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Well;&rdquo; the sister said, &ldquo;admirably; it is especially
good for the boys, who, in this country, are so arrogant
and overbearing. They are born with a contempt for
girls; and begin, when they are but little things, to lord
it over them. But it has a wonderful influence to humble
their pride, to find the girls fully their equals, as they
are, in their classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke says, that &ldquo;the error of the co-education of
the sexes, and which prophesies their identical co-education
in colleges and universities, is not confined to technical
education. It permeates society.&rdquo; That it does
so, is true, but that it is always an &ldquo;error,&rdquo; we should not
so readily admit, as one of its permeating effects upon
society in Beyrout, may illustrate. In one church,
through conformity to Oriental prejudices against any
sign of equality between men and women, the sittings
designed for the men on one side, and the women on
the other, had always been separated by a heavy curtain
drawn between them. Reaching far above the heads of
the worshippers, even when they should be standing, it
had formed a complete partition wall, dividing the
church up to the space in front of the preacher's desk.
But this curtain had, within the last few months, been removed,
and the minister was now, on Sundays, dispensing
a straightforward gospel, the same to men and women.
Thus was the co-education system in the school already
permeating the church! This was noticed with surprise
by a missionary whom I had met on the Mediterranean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
returning, after two or three years' absence in this country,
to his former mission field, and who entered the
church, for the first time after his return, with me.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;this denotes a great advance in
Christian sentiment! This is as it should be. And how
does it work?&rdquo; he asked of the pastor of the church, in
delighted surprise. &ldquo;Admirably,&rdquo; was the reply. There
was some remonstrance on the part of some of the older
men at first, but even they did not seem to think anything
about it any longer, and it was so much more
agreeable preaching to the people all together, than to
have his congregation separated by that high wall of a
curtain, and to seem to be dispensing one kind of gospel
to the men, and another to the women, of his church.
Yet I had heard this good man, in a conversation with
brethren who had come down to Joppa to meet him on
his return, discussing with severe reprobation &ldquo;this absurd
woman movement&rdquo; in America, &ldquo;opposed to
Christianity,&rdquo; &ldquo;unsettling the churches,&rdquo; &ldquo;pervading
society in a thousand ways,&rdquo; &ldquo;subversive of social order
and refinement;&rdquo; and, as one of its most ridiculous, almost
monstrous effects, &ldquo;putting into girls' heads the idea
of going to college with the young men!&rdquo; So little did
he recognize as one impulse of the wave of the &ldquo;woman
movement,&rdquo; what he had but now been so heartily commending!
So often is the Babe of Bethlehem nurtured
by those who, seeing him as he is, a fair and beautiful
child, welcome and worship him; but who, looking
through the mists of prejudice, especially fearing through
him some subversion of their power, position, or interest,
cry: &ldquo;Away with him! crucify him! crucify him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Beyrout I had several conversations with a most
intelligent Armenian gentleman, from Constantinople,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
occupying an important governmental position. Having
under my charge several young ladies travelling for
study and instruction, our conversation very naturally
turned upon our American educational systems, about
which he was much better informed than many members
of our public school boards. He had read our school
reports, and his knowledge of our methods, courses of
study, etc., surprised me. He discussed them, especially
remarking upon the broadening influence of the increasing
attention paid to the sciences in our schools, and the
comparative effect of the positive sciences and the languages
upon national character. And could it be possible
that young men and young ladies pursued these studies
together, he asked. The school reports which he had
read would indicate this, yet he could hardly believe it
possible. I must pardon him if he had seemed to observe
the young ladies too closely, but he had been interested
to study the influence of our ideas of education upon
the first American girls he had ever met. And I could
not imagine how the difference struck him&mdash;how it struck
all Eastern men. Their freedom, their energy, their
companionableness, was so different from women of the
East. &ldquo;And yet, they are perfectly modest!&rdquo; he said.
He had observed their anxiety to visit places of historical
interest, getting up early in the morning and walking a
long distance to do this. He had seen elegant, pleasing
women in the East, women of graceful manners&mdash;the
Eastern women were often that&mdash;but he had met few
educated women. Their women were trained to please,
but they were never educated to be a man's intellectual
companion. No Eastern man ever thought of a companion
in a wife. But stopping thoughtfully for a moment,
and seizing one of our idioms in his hesitating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
English, he said, &ldquo;Yet I can't see for the life of me why
it would not be better that she should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the frank, involuntary utterance of a cultivated
man, brought suddenly, for the first time, as he
said, to consider the question of the education of women,
an elemental half of humanity, in the unbiassed, comprehensive
view of the subject that can alone lead to a
just decision. He was an Eastern man, outside of the
turmoil and interests of the discussion. No personal or
professional craft lurked unrecognized behind his conclusions
to give them a bias. With him it was a question
of social science, general human happiness and welfare.
With us, however, where it has become a practical
question touching domestic, social, and professional interests,
its complications multiply, and it is exceedingly
difficult for the most honest and unselfish occupants of
place or privilege, to look at it without touching, in some
of its intricacies, the question, &ldquo;Does not space for her
to bourgeon,&rdquo; imply restricting me and mine?</p>

<p>The old Chinese wall of prejudice, surrounding the
subject of woman's education, from which there are so
many out-comes, is not broken down yet. We only learn
how strong it is when we come to some new point in the
siege or defence. Sermons that have been preached at
learned women, and jokes perpetrated at their expense,
are still issued in modernized editions, and scare and
sting as of yore. It is quite curious to note how the
style changes, but the thought remains the same. Our
fathers planned our earliest educational institutions according
to the best they knew. Our mothers economized
and hoarded that they might leave bequests to colleges
and theological schools, where their sons could be educated;
while their daughters picked up such crumbs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
knowledge as they could find. Both wrought their best,
according to the light of their day, but the shadow of
their fuller eclipse extends to us. Calvin's requirements
in a wife were with them as weighty to determine
woman's status in society as was his &ldquo;Five Points in
Theology,&rdquo; their creed: &ldquo;That she be learned is not
requisite. That she be beautiful, only that she be not
ill-looking, is not important. But she must be of sound
health, that she may bear me children. She must be
industrious, economical, obedient, and know how to take
good care of <i>my</i> health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the summary of what women needed to know
and be, in the opinion of one regarded by our fathers as
a law-giver, entrusted with the oracles of God. An old
manuscript copy of a sermon, esteemed fifty years ago so
rich in thought as to make it worth transcribing, to keep
among family treasures, lies before me. From it, among
more piquant instructions, I copy a sentence: &ldquo;But if
thou wilt please God, take much pains with thy heart, to
make it stand in awe of thy husband. Look, therefore,
not on his qualities but on his place, for if thou despisest
him, thy contempt redounds upon God.&rdquo; &ldquo;When a
woman counts herself equal with her husband, though he
be of meaner birth and smaller capacity, the root of all
good carriage is dried up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In proof that we have outlived only the form of such
sentiment, I recommend the reading of Part VII. of Mr.
Hamerton's &ldquo;Intellectual Life,&rdquo; a very recent publication,
and, the reviewers say, &ldquo;a charming book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a discourse on &ldquo;Women and Marriage&rdquo; he says:
&ldquo;It appears to be thought wise to teach boys things
which women do not learn, in order to give them a degree
of respect for men's attainments which they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
not feel, were they prepared to estimate them critically.&rdquo;
This educational policy and its workings Mr. Hamerton
illustrates by numerous examples. He says: &ldquo;The
opinion of a distinguished artist was, that a man devoted
to art might marry either a plain-minded woman who
would occupy herself exclusively with household matters,
and shield his peace by taking these cares upon herself,
or else a woman quite capable of entering into his artistic
life. * * * And of the two kinds of women which
he considered possible, he preferred the former, that of
an entirely ignorant person, from whom no interference
was to be apprehended. He considered the first Madam
Ingres the true model of an artist's wife, because she did
all in her power to guard her husband's peace, and never
herself disturbed him, acting the part of a breakwater,
which protects a space of calm and never disturbs the
peace it has made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman too ignorant to wish to comprehend her husband
lest she should meddle in his pursuits, and who
should find her crumb of the happiness that human life
and family compact ought to yield, in &ldquo;acting as a breakwater&rdquo;
to protect him, and &ldquo;never disturb his peace,&rdquo;
was a great artist's view of the education needed by a
woman! To this I would oppose my more humble experience,
but I am sure there are women enough who
would add theirs thereto, to make the sum equal in
weight to that of Mr. Hamerton's artist friend. Among
the women whom I have known in life, the most highly
intellectual have been the least meddlesome; for the very
good reason that they have been too busy with the work
of their own brains to meddle with what concerned other
people. Nor have such women been less the helps, fitted,
if need be, to act as &ldquo;breakwaters&rdquo; to protect the calm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of a man engaged in any great work. On the contrary,
the discipline acquired in study and thought has been
turned to account in this way, as well as in any other.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamerton gives another friend's view of the education
needful for a woman,&mdash;&ldquo;one of the most intellectual
men he ever knew,&rdquo; but &ldquo;whose wife really knew
nothing of his intellectual existence whatever.&rdquo; His
theory was &ldquo;that women ought not to be admitted to the
region of masculine thought; it is not good for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Dr. Clarke evidently thinks, and thinks he proves
it physiologically. The existence of the terrible evils he
depicts is not to be doubted; and she would be less than
a true woman who did not protest, by precept, preaching,
and example, against the follies and sins of school or social
life that induce such evils: but that it was eating of
the fruit of the tree of knowledge&mdash;&ldquo;persistent brain-work&rdquo;
even&mdash;that furnished Dr. Clarke's cases, &ldquo;chiefly
clinical,&rdquo; an experience of teaching extending over forty
years would forbid me to believe.</p>

<p>As a woman, I have heard the smothered cry of woe
as pitiful, of suffering as great, from those who prayed
for death as a relief&mdash;though it was not from suffering of
the body&mdash;as any that Dr. Clarke describes.</p>

<p>In our pity for physical suffering, some may well be
reserved for the soul of her who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Sighs amid her narrow days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving about the household ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that dark house where she was born.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed, the supposition of Dr. Clarke that psychical
influences may have caused diseases which he describes,
casts light upon some sad cases of invalidism which I
have known, and where disease may quite as probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
have been induced by soul-loneliness&mdash;intellectual starvation&mdash;as
by the brain-work which, in his cases, he assumes
to be the cause.</p>

<p>In the new education which is preparing for our girls,
I trust regard will be paid to training physicians for the
souls of women, as well as for their bodies, and there
will surely be needed that very &ldquo;feminine subtlety&rdquo;
that divines, if it does not reason out, a cause. &ldquo;I believe
in educating women to be physicians since I have
read that book, if I never did before,&rdquo; has been the exclamation
of many women who have read it. We want
women physicians, educated to habits of thinking, logical,
as well as physiological&mdash;capable of tracing psychical, as
well as physical, causes. We want teachers so educated,
women drawn to study the science of teaching through
a love of it, as Florence Nightingale was led through
seven years' preparation for her work&mdash;as a naturalist or
an artist is drawn to his work. We want women on our
School Boards and among our visiting committees, who
know how to estimate the trust committed to them, and
who will give time, thought, and study to their duties.</p>

<p>The science of education is, to-day, where the science
of geology was fifty years ago. We are just beginning
to think of it as a science. Men and women are waking
up to its demands. Children, with their infinite variety
of organizations, temperaments, and idiosyncracies, can
no more be educated at random than plants, gathered
from the four quarters of the earth, can be perfected
through the same culture, and in the same climate and
soil. Each child in the great crowd that gathers in our
schools, is in some respects like a particular musical instrument,
designed by God, in its complicated mechanism,
to perform its particular part, to yield its own par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>ticular
tone in the diapason of life; and I shudder when
I think how rudely it is often played upon by untaught
teachers&mdash;teachers who have drifted to their work, or resorted
to it as a temporary occupation, for its profits, but
who have never thought of studying its principles, as
physicians, lawyers, artists, study the principles of their
professions. Played upon by the unskilled hands of
those who have never troubled themselves to study the
physical, much less the psychic delicacy of this wonderful
human instrument, the only wonder is, that society
should yield the harmonies it does. No! women need
to think more, not less; to increase, not diminish brain-work;
to overlive the drudgery of it, whether it involve
teaching, writing, study, the work of a profession, or
house-work, by breathing into it the living spirit of love,
which sanctifies and ennobles whatever the hands or the
brain find to do.</p>

<p>As regards different methods of education and their
results, the old New England Academies may furnish
some useful lessons. These began to be established from
fifty to seventy-five years ago, and are now mostly displaced
by Union and High Schools. But they were the
initiate of a very important revolution in the status of
the education of girls. In their earliest educational plans,
our fathers had not taken their girls much into account.
But these academies, though not planned with any special
reference to giving the girls of the New England
villages and the rural districts the opportunities of education,
at once established a system of co-education, where
the girls and the young men met on terms of as entire
equality as any co-educational plan has ever since contemplated.
The academy edifice was most frequently built
by voluntary subscription from persons of all religious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
sects, and the school was in charge of trustees, so chosen
as to avoid any sectarian bias or rivalry in its management.
The building generally crowned some hill, or
stood in the midst of a grove where spacious grounds
could be obtained. The school was usually under charge
of a gentleman teacher&mdash;some college graduate&mdash;and a
lady assistant. The course of study, aside from a course
designed to fit young men for college, was largely elective.
These schools were as perfect educational republics
as can be imagined. The young men and the young
women met in their classes, on terms of entire equality
and respect for each other. There were few rules in the
school, and as to government, the pupils were mostly put
upon their honor. The course of study was frequently
identical, and with the exception of the Greek&mdash;sometimes
the Latin&mdash;designed to fit young men for college&mdash;largely
so.</p>

<p>My own course was precisely that of the young men in
every study, though Greek, to which I was persuaded by
my minister, led me through a cruel martyrdom of jokes
from my companions. Repeating at school what their
mothers said at home, they even then satirized me with
proposals to get up petitions to open the doors of our
State University to girls &ldquo;who wanted to be men&rdquo; I
felt these jokes so keenly, that at first I pursued my
study of Greek covertly, reciting out of school. But,
cheered by my minister's encouragement, I lived down
jokes, and went into the class with the young men,
kept up with them, and continued the study until they
went to college, and beyond, until a call from one of
our Female Seminaries for a teacher &ldquo;who had been
educated by a man,&rdquo; broke up a course that I would
have been glad to have extended through college. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
that without &ldquo;wishing to be a man,&rdquo; without wishing for
anything but to gratify a love of study, which was just
as natural to me as to those I had thus far studied with.
The daily hours of school were more than in our High
schools, and we had recitations always, as usual, up to
twelve o'clock on Saturday, while the number of recitations
a student was allowed to have, nearly always exceeded the
number allowed in our High schools. I have never in
any schools known more thorough and persistent study
than was performed by students in these academies, and
the standing of the girls was invariably as high as that
of the young men. Such recitations as we had in History,
Moral and Intellectual Philosophy, were like a life
elixir; we went from them, not wearied, exhausted, but
rested, exhilarated. We had gained bodily strength as
well as mental clearness and force. They had infused life.</p>

<p>And where are the girls, who, forty, even fifty years
ago, made trial of &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; study, of the dangerous
system of co-education in the Academies? There has
surely been sufficient time to test its physical effects on
them. Where are they? Scattered throughout the world,
a host of noble women, many of them doing brain-work
still.</p>

<p>If my limits would permit, I could give the history of
scores of them who were educated mostly in those academies,
and who have continued study and brain-work
ever since&mdash;who have borne children, reared families, and
are yet strong and healthy, far beyond the average of
women who have lived in ease and idleness&mdash;quite as
healthy as women devoted alone to domestic cares.</p>

<p>The invalids on a long list of old associates which
Dr. Clarke's book has led me to call to mind and look
up, are, I have been surprised to find, among those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
did &ldquo;run well for a time,&rdquo; but they have turned back
and ceased mental labor. Some have fallen into worldliness
and a fashionable life, and are broken down under it.
Others, restricted to some narrow creed of thought, have
not dared to open their eyes to the light of any new day
that is dawning on the world, until, ceasing to grow, they
have, according to a law of nature, fallen into decay, invalidism,
and &ldquo;nervous prostration.&rdquo; Bringing this subject
before several experienced persons, teachers, and one
a physician, in the light in which I have aimed to bring
it before my readers, I have asked, &ldquo;And were these
cases of invalidism (cases of which we have been speaking)
from your best scholars? Were they, in short, persons
still continuing to grow?&rdquo; Stopping a moment to
think, they have, in two instances at least, given precisely
the same answer: &ldquo;I never thought of that before, but
they were not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are some other things that characterized methods,
of study in those academies of forty or fifty years ago,
that may instruct us. While the girls studied harder,
had more recitations, extending through more hours in a
day than are required in any of our High schools, they
seldom studied in school, but at their homes or at their
boarding places. This gave them freedom of position,
liberty to sit or stand or walk, when they were at work
on a difficult problem, or engaged in close thinking&mdash;an
advantage which any one who has been a close student
in later life, must appreciate&mdash;an advantage which I have
recently heard young ladies in our university say, they
could hardly conceive of before they went to the university
from the high school where they fitted. This also
led them almost every hour into the open air, and to
take a little exercise, as the girls in our university and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in some of our colleges are forced to do, effecting a visible
and marked improvement in the standard of health
among the girls in the university above that of the girls
in the High schools.</p>

<p>Again, they had seldom more than one flight of stairs
to climb; nor were they, in climbing these, burdened
with skirts that weigh five, six, and even seven pounds,
such as I know from actual weight, carefully reported,
young girls of the present time sometimes wear in climbing
three immense flights of stairs! Let any woman
undertake this with her arms full of books, her hands
tied in holding them, so that she cannot clear her feet
from her long, heavy skirt, with its manifold flounces
switching about them, while she is laboring to lift them
with a movement of her hips and pinioned arms, and yet
feels herself liable every instant to be thrown from her
balance by all this encumbrance&mdash;let her undertake this,
and she will learn that there is something besides study
that is endangering the health of our school girls. Again,
let her take her stand at the top of one of these long flights
of stairs&mdash;the last in the building, perhaps&mdash;reaching up
to the floor where the High school rooms are almost
always located; let her watch the flushed faces of a class
of girls coming up to recitation, note the palpitating,
almost breathless efforts with which some of them achieve
the last few steps; and when they have accomplished
this, see here and there one clinging to the post of the
balustrade, or leaning speechless against the wall until
she can recover breath to proceed another step; let her
do this, and she will get another insight into the causes
of invalidism among the girl graduates of our schools.
&ldquo;How can a mother rest when she doesn't know where
her boys are?&rdquo; we often hear asked. How can a mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
rest when she doesn't know where her girls are, or by
what dangerous steps they have gone where they are?
How can she rest? Simply, in most instances, because
she has not herself been educated to any comprehension
of the danger her child is in.</p>

<p>Neither did school-girls, in that earlier time, perform
their brain labor under an outside pressure scarcely less
than that of one of those iron helmets which one sees in
the Tower of London, and which, the guide assures us,
with an emphasis implying that he does not expect us
to believe it, were actually worn by some Knight at the
battle of Cressy, Agincourt, or some other which resulted
in victory to the English. And how those old warriors
did bear up under a head-gear weighing ten or twelve
pounds, to fight the battles of their age, I have been best
able to comprehend when I have seen what girls of our
age can bear up under and live at all, much more, study.</p>

<p>I have a friend, an old pupil, a truly intellectual
woman, who has not broken down under much more
brain-work, since she left school, than she ever performed
in school. Her husband greatly enjoys her
intellectual tastes, and, without stint or jealousy, encourages
them; only he would not have her &ldquo;odd,&rdquo; nor
so very different from &ldquo;other ladies of our acquaintance.&rdquo;
He would have her study; he &ldquo;doesn't believe a woman
should fall back in her intellectual life any more than a
man.&rdquo; He would have her paint, and practise, and study;
and since he provides abundant help, he thinks she may.
He will buy any book, or set of books, to aid her; but
he would have her wear her hair as &ldquo;other ladies wear
theirs, and not give occasion for all those flings about
women who want to know so much,&rdquo; and go with their
hair about their faces and themselves at &ldquo;sixes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
sevens,&rdquo; generally. &ldquo;And why can't she wear her
hair put up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sit down, and I will tell you
why,&rdquo; she said, one day, rather out of sorts; he
did not yield very ready compliance. But she persuaded
him to permit her to illustrate her &ldquo;why.&rdquo; He sat
down, and she began by twisting his abundant curls into
a knot as tight as could well be held by a strong hair-pin.
This was the &ldquo;underpinning&rdquo; on which to rear the
structure. So, with &ldquo;switch&rdquo; upon &ldquo;switch,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;braid&rdquo; surrounding &ldquo;braid,&rdquo; a &ldquo;frizz&rdquo; here and a
&ldquo;frizz&rdquo; there, with a few bows for capitals, and a few
curls for streamers, and twenty-four hair-pins for fastenings
and bracing-rods, the tower was finished, in less than
half the time, as she assured him, owing to the advantageous
position she enjoyed in her work, that it would take
her to rear the same structure on her own head, and it was
precisely like what other ladies of their acquaintance wore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you do not pretend
that women wear all this false pile on their
heads!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I not only pretend, but solemnly
assure you that I have not exceeded by a braid or a curl
what most of the ladies of our acquaintance wear on their
heads.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what do women want to be such fools
for?&rdquo; he asked impatiently. &ldquo;What did you want me
to be such a fool for?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Well, take down
the thing and let me go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;you may wear your
hair as you please, I have learned <i>why</i> enough for one
day.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, stay and let us read that chapter of Mill on
'Liberty' that we were going to read together sometime,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Liberty! I think so. I wouldn't wear that
thing half a day for all the profits of my business for a
year!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then, we'll let Mill go, for I think if I
have taught you <i>why</i>, with all that toggery on my head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
I can't do anything, I have done enough for one day,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>Think of a girl thus burdened working through a
problem in mathematics, or arranging, in her mind, an
analysis of it, which will be called for in five minutes; or,
of her thinking over, so as to give clearly, with its heads
and deductions, an abstract of a chapter in some branch
of science! She will say, perhaps, that &ldquo;one gets used
to it and thinks nothing about it,&rdquo; and she thinks, no
doubt, that what she says is quite true. But go to her
room in the evening after the world is shut out, and you
will, in all probability, find her with her wrapper on and
her &ldquo;braids&rdquo; and &ldquo;switches&rdquo; off, and she will tell you,
without thinking, what is nearer the truth&mdash;that you
must excuse her, but she has a &ldquo;hard lesson to get, and
she can study so much better in this way, when she feels
perfectly comfortable.&rdquo; A straw will tell which way the
wind blows, and straws of hair-pins, during months of
pain and feebleness, may, in after life, tell which way the
wind has blown.</p>

<p>Just in face of some of these hindrances, in the way
of the higher education of our girls, I place some reports
from schools and colleges which I have received.
The following is from a teacher of high reputation, Superintendent
of Public Schools in one of our large cities, a
gentleman who has studied the science of teaching as few
have done, and added to the usual attainments of a college
graduate, studies which would have given him a right to
practise as a physician. He has now been engaged in
his profession, without a term's remission, for thirty
years:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not hard study that breaks down the health of
our girls, but the circumstances under which they study,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the demands of society and its thousand social follies,
with all their excitements. It is the foolish ambition of
parents to have their daughters accomplished before they
are out of their teens, often allowing them to carry on
five or six branches at a time instead of two or three.
These, and some other like causes, as I think, do
more towards breaking down the health of girls at
school, than much study. The ability on the part of
the girls to master the several branches, is fully equal to
that of the boys, and when an amount of study is reached
that is injurious to girls, we have gone as far as is profitable
for boys. Boys also break down in study, from some
of the evils of society. As to co-education of the sexes,
my experience, observation, and reading, all convince me
that it is the best way. If there are incidental evils in
such a course, they are only incidental, and I can find
those of equal, or, I think, of greater magnitude in separate
schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michigan has tried the experiment of co-education
perhaps as thoroughly and extensively as any State in the
Union&mdash;as any territory of equal extent in the world.
Her six colleges, her University, her Normal school, all
her higher institutions of learning&mdash;with the exception
of the Michigan Female Seminary, on the Mt. Holyoke
plan, and some young ladies' private schools&mdash;are open to
young men and to young women on the same terms.
There are no separate roads for the sexes up the Hill of
Science, from the lowest primary, to the highest professional
school. Kalamazoo College, against the opinion
of many educated and educational men, admitted women
to a full curriculum, twenty years ago. And classes,
about equally divided, have been graduating from the
college ever since, confirming the authors of the move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>ment
and the whole Faculty, during these twenty years,
in the practicability and the many advantages of the
plan. The young women have always averaged as good
scholarship and health as the young men. A <i>smaller</i>
number of women than <ins class="corr" title="missing word &ldquo;men&rdquo;">have</ins> abandoned their course
on account of ill health. During the period of my
own connection with this institution, many young women
pursued there an extended elective course of study,
who did not graduate. It was not their plan to do so
when they entered the preparatory department. Many
graduated from a course quite as extensive, requiring as
persistent study, though not in all respects like that of
the young men. They did not usually study Greek,
though some did, and were leaders of their classes. They
did not pursue Latin quite so far, but more than made
up for this in a far more thorough study of French and
German, History and Literature. There is scarcely a
week in the year but I receive communications in some
way from some of these old pupils. They are among
my most enjoyable, intellectual, and literary correspondents.
With few exceptions, they are <i>growing</i> women.
Having learned how to learn&mdash;which they will all remember,
was the most I ever professed to be able to teach
them&mdash;they have instituted schools for themselves, compelled
sometimes very hard circumstances to become their
best teachers, and learned to draw lessons, as Mr. Emerson
once said in a lecture to them, from &ldquo;frost and fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some have learned to use the world as not abusing it,
and are turning wealth and its advantages that have come
to them, to useful, noble purposes. A few, but very few,
of the large number, are invalids, but there is not one
whose case does not furnish me with abundant evidence
of many more probable causes of invalidism, than over-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>study.
There is not one, of whom I have heard, whose
case does not wear on the face of it decidedly other
causes than &ldquo;persistent study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Mahan, who was the first, and for fifteen years,
President of Oberlin College, has since been for nearly
as long a period the President of Adrian College, in this
State. He says that, during his connection with Oberlin,
the proportion of young men to young women
who entered upon the course, and failed to complete
it on account of failure of health, under the strain
of thought and study, was at least <i>two to one</i>. The
proportion was not quite so great in Adrian; but many
more young men than young women&mdash;and, as far as
he was acquainted with colleges, everywhere&mdash;succumbed
under the change from their former life to one
of study.</p>

<p>Dr. Mahan also says that, owing to the peculiar circumstances
under which Oberlin College was established,
he has, through subsequent years, maintained a far more
familiar acquaintance with his former students than is
common for old teachers to do; and that he can count
many more broken-down men, among his old graduates,
than broken-down women. It would be impossible for one
now to conceive the obstacles in the way of the girls
who were first admitted to study at Oberlin. Every step
was achieved through a moral battle with public opinion
and popular prejudice, the depressing effects of which
cannot now be estimated. And yet they did go
through&mdash;stood as high during their whole course, and
in their graduating exercises, as the young men. They
are all of them married, mothers of families of children,
and are strong and healthy, far above the average of
American women.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>During almost thirty years that he has been president
of college faculty meetings, he has never <i>once</i>
heard, from any member of the Faculty, any intimation
that the girls in the class were in any way whatever a
drag upon the class. They invariably keep up, and oftener
come out ahead than they lag behind. Nor is
this more characteristic in one branch of study than
another. Languages, science, philosophy, they grasp
as clearly, strongly, and comprehensively as men; and
as the result of his observation and of his experience,
which, he says, in co-education in a higher course of
study, has perhaps been greater than that of any man in
the world, he thinks that while it is just as much better
for men to be so educated as it is for women, the result to
the latter is to make them more practical, more natural,
less given to effeminate, rather than feminine affectations,
and more readily adaptive to anything life may demand
of them than any class of women he has ever
known. Also, in the particular of health, he has carefully
observed the effects of close and continued study,
not only during the course, but in subsequent life, and
he will risk his reputation for truthful statements, in
saying that he believes&mdash;that he knows&mdash;the most careful
statistics would show among the women who are college
graduates, whom he has known, a higher standard of
health than among the same number of women from any
class of society&mdash;working women, fashionable women,
or women of merely quiet, domestic habits. And yet,
&ldquo;every well-developed, well-balanced woman who is a
graduate from our colleges has actually performed one-fourth
<i>more</i> labor than a man who has stood by her side,
and she is entitled to one-fourth more credit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A girl should be as free to choose for herself as a boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
is. She can never truly know herself, nor be known by
others, as the power in the world, greater or less, which
she was ordained by God to be, until these thousand restrictions
that limit and dwarf her intellectual life are
removed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Let her make herself her own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give or keep, to live, and learn, and be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that not harms distinctive womanhood.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have recently been assured by one of the best students
that have ever graduated from our University, and by
another who graduated from Hillsdale College in this
State, from precisely the same course as the gentlemen
students, that to girls of average capacity, the college
course, all that is required of the young men&mdash;and all
that <i>they</i> are accustomed to perform&mdash;is not by any means
difficult, and will not over-tax any girl of average health
and abilities, who is properly prepared when she enters.
But the trouble is that while girls like the studies in the
regular course, and study with a real relish, they want
more. They are not satisfied with the French and German
of a course, they want to speak and write these languages,
and add extra private lessons to those of the
regular classes. The few lessons of the course in perspective
drawing have, in some, awakened an artistic taste,
and they want to pursue drawing farther. There are
better teachers to be found in the vicinity of a University
than they will find at home, and they are constantly
tempted to do too much. A number of girls in the literary
course of the University attend the medical lectures
in certain departments, some teach students who are
&ldquo;conditioned&rdquo; in certain branches. From all the colleges,
the report in this respect is the same&mdash;girls can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
easily do all that is required of the young men, but they
will do more. And yet the report from every college
is&mdash;<i>more young men break down during a course, and
are obliged, from ill health, to abandon their studies, than
young women</i>. This certainly does not threaten danger
to girls who attempt only the same that the young men
do. The tendency in our colleges towards elective courses
of study is in the right direction to remove the dangerous
temptation into which girls are liable to fall&mdash;of
taking studies outside the course. I hope to see even
greater freedom of choice.</p>

<p>From a woman, a mother, and lover of little children,
a few words about school buildings and school
methods may not be out of place.</p>

<p>Americans are proverbially giving to boasting. People
of the older world tell us that this is an expression of our
undeveloped youth&mdash;a kind of <i>Sophomorism</i> denoting
that we are yet not very far advanced. Be that as it
may, I have observed that there is no more common subject
for boasting than our schools and our school system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are our King's Palaces, where we are training
our future monarchs! Those are the towers of our defence&mdash;the
bulwarks of our republic!&rdquo; I heard a western
Congressman exclaim, as the railway train whizzed
past one of those immense school edifices which so closely
dot the area of many of our western States, that one
scarcely loses sight of one ere the high towers and ornate
roofs of another come into view. &ldquo;I will acknowledge
that I am proud&mdash;feel like boasting, when I can
point a foreigner to such buildings as those, and tell him
they are but our common free schools, open to every child
in the land, rich and poor, alike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The friend addressed, an intelligent, shrewd, naturalized
Scotchman, replied that he was &ldquo;a little old fogy,&rdquo;
he supposed, but that those great high buildings, where
six or eight hundred children were gathered in one school,
were like great cities, where too many people were gathered
together. School life, no more than city life, could
be healthy, nor just what life ought to be, under such conditions.
To carry out these great union school plans,
made a necessity for too much machinery. This it was
which was grinding out the education of our children,
rather than developing thought, and the result would be
machine education. He said that school was a continual
worry at home. One child was kept after school one
day for one thing, and another the next day for some
other thing, and there was a deal of worry and fretting
about how they were marked, and a good deal more talk
about the marks for the lesson, than there was about
what was in the lesson itself. One little girl, a delicate
lassie, they had been obliged to take out of school. The
child didn't eat, couldn't sleep, and was getting in a bad
way altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no more color in L&mdash;&mdash;'s face when she is
getting off to school in the morning, than there is in my
handkerchief, she is so afraid of being marked,&rdquo; said a
mother to me a day or two since. &ldquo;Yesterday morning
was especially one of trial to the child. I wish you could
have seen her when she got off, or rather when she got
home at night, and have heard her story. I had charged
her not to hurry so, but come back if she was going to
fail; I would rather she would lose the day than to gain
her school through such an effort.&rdquo; The child reached
the school, and came home at night to tell how. Rushing
into the house, the delicately organized, nervous lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>tle
girl exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, mamma, I did get there; and
the best of it was, I overtook G&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash; (another as delicate
child); she was as late as I was, and we both ran
every step. We managed to get our things off in the
wardrobe and get into our seats, but G&mdash;&mdash; could not
get her mittens off; and when she at last dropped into
her seat, she put both hands up to her face and burst
out crying as loud as she could cry. Oh, I did feel so
sorry for her!&rdquo; The effort of getting to school, the fear
of the marks, had thrown the delicate child into hysterics,
given her physical system a shock, and made demands on
her brain that a year's study could not have done. I
could fill a volume, as could any observing woman, with
instances like this&mdash;the occurrences of every day in the
year. They cannot, perhaps, be helped. Teachers are
not to be blamed for them. Six or eight hundred children
cannot be hindered for one child. All are tied to
too much machinery.</p>

<p>In some of the public schools which I have visited in
Germany, the lessons for children eleven and twelve
years old seemed to me more difficult than the lessons
set for children of the same age in our public schools;
and our children are not in school nearly so many hours
in a day as the children in German schools, which are
so often referred to, not only as model educational institutions,
but conservators of health as well. Children in
Germany go to school at seven o'clock in the morning.
In very early morning walks, I have often met scores of
German children, with their little soldier-like knapsack
of books strapped to their shoulders, and have stopped
them to examine their school-books, and inquire about
their schools. In a little valley in Switzerland, seeing a
bevy of children starting, so many in one direction, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>fore
it was light in the morning, I inquired where all
those children were going. &ldquo;To the school, to be
sure,&rdquo; I was answered. &ldquo;But they cannot see to read
or study,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;<i>O, sie m&uuml;ssen Licht mitnehmen</i>&rdquo;
(they must take a light with them), was the reply.</p>

<br />
<p>Our modes of education will be changed; there are
defects to be remedied, evils to be cured, which affect
both sexes; but women will be educated. All the tendencies
of the age are towards a higher intellectual culture
for them. Women's clubs, classes, library and
literary associations, are, throughout our cities and villages&mdash;in
little country neighborhoods, even&mdash;furnishing
women with means of intellectual growth and advancement.
There is no more marked feature of the age than
these associations. The Babe of Bethlehem is born, and
has even now too far escaped the search of Herod to be
overtaken.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything in the spirit of the times which
betokens the revival of the nunnery and monastic systems.
Women already tread almost every avenue of honest thrift
and business, unchallenged. The shrines of Minerva will
not be desecrated by their presence. Their intellect will
be developed, and their affections will be cultivated, and
all truly womanly virtues fostered in the innermost penetralia
even, of that temple where all wisdom, and all art,
and all science, are taught; whose patron deity was prophetically
made by a mythology, wise beyond its own
ken, not a man, not a god&mdash;but a goddess, a typical
woman.</p>

<p>As surely as girls persistently breathe the same air
their brothers breathe, eat and drink as they do, go with
them to church, public lectures, concerts, plays, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
social entertainments, so will they, in the new and more
truly Christian era that is dawning, come, more and
more, to study with them, from youth to old age, in the
academy, the sacred groves of philosophy, halls of science,
schools of theology&mdash;everywhere and &ldquo;persistently.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Girls and Women</span></h2>
<h3>IN<br />
ENGLAND AND AMERICA.</h3>

<p>When I was giving, in Dundee, a lecture upon the
Education of Women in America, the substance of which
appeared in the <i>Westminster Review</i> of October, 1873,
the chairman, on introducing me, said. &ldquo;De Tocqueville,
the French philosopher, considered that the chief cause
of the great prosperity of the American nation is the
superiority of the women; now we are to hear to-night
how these women are produced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two things uniformly strike foreign travellers in our
country; the general intelligence of the people, and the
equality of the education and intellectual interests of the
men and the women; and few remarks are oftener heard
from those who have visited us, or have known our
countrymen and women on the Continent than this:
&ldquo;American women seem so much superior to the men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a third fact stands just as boldly forth&mdash;the thin,
unhealthy-looking physique and nervous sensibility of
the American people; and the impression of this is
deepened by comparing us with our original ancestors,
the English, confessedly the finest physical race in the
world. These facts&mdash;the superior average education in
America, and the inferior average physique of the nation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>&mdash;are
so striking, that it is strange that they have not
oftener and more forcibly been placed together as cause
and effect. The education has gone on increasing, and
the physique has gone on declining, till now the census
returns begin to make us look anxiously about us. Our
men are unmuscular and short-lived, the best of them;
the men of a physique of the type of Chief Justice Chase
rarely live beyond sixty or sixty-five. They are not
invalids, but they are subject to fever, congestion, and
paralysis, violent crises. The women are slight, graceful,
impressionable, and active. In the poorer ranks of life
they have a nervous, anxious look; in the well-to-do and
wealthier ranks, a nervous, spiritual look. They are not
invalids, but they are delicate, and are kept under a constant
and chafing restraint from want of strength to carry
out the plans they set before them, and they give an unsatisfactory
prospect for the coming generations. Our
census reports are very trustworthy oracles; these give
us dark omens, and it is folly to shut our eyes.</p>

<p>Many causes may be assigned as contributing to this
physical deterioration, any one of which, with a little ingenuity,
may be clearly made to appear responsible for
almost the whole; and such, in some degree, is the temporary
effect of the very clever feint of Dr. Clarke&mdash;nothing
else can it be called. The book gives us the
impression that the author is going to attack our effort
to produce the kind of women upon which any shrewd
observer must see that our unparalleled prosperity to a
great degree rests. It makes us believe he is going to
attack the very method to which our success in educating
women is due; and it makes us fear that he is going to
attack the modern doubt concerning the old theory, that
&ldquo;the highest and ultimate aim of a woman is to be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
satisfactory wife of one man, and the nourishing mother
of another;&rdquo; but he does not even try to do any one of
these things. He has thrown a calcium light upon one
spot, revealing some defects, and many eyes are for a
time drawn towards it. His feint has created a sensation,
and brought an important subject up to a grade of
familiarity and openness where it can be talked of and
examined, and I closed the book with a great sense of
obligation on behalf of my nation.</p>

<p>I have long felt that physicians, themselves, have no
adequate impression of the danger we are incurring in
the average neglect that attends the physical rearing of
American girls, and subsequent care of young women,
nor adequate knowledge of their tendency to weakness
in their present condition. Mothers are busy, and girls
are left too much to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>From considerable personal knowledge, I am aware that
the present state of things ought to occasion anxiety;
that girls, ignorant of the consequences, are disposed to
conceal any weakness or unnatural condition, through
their great aversion to medical attendance, and from a
dislike to restrictions upon their social pleasures; and
also from the fear that these restrictions would produce
suspicion among their friends in regard to their condition.
I am sure that I am stating facts that are not appreciated
in the degree that they deserve.</p>

<p>Looked at physically, and with a philanthropy that extends
beyond our contemporaries, English women do not
allow us to feel wholly satisfied with our American women.
They make us feel that there is a debit as well as
a credit column when we compare our system of social
life with theirs. But we must not be so unwise as to
attribute the fault to four or five years in the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
girl's life; nor must we be so short-sighted as to limit
the responsibility to the present generation. Our own
grandmothers did thus and so; but, as Miss Phelps says,
this is the very reason that we cannot do it; nor can we
afford to be so unjust as to make women bear the whole
blame, nor so injudicious as to criminate our society as
a whole. Crime implies bad intentions, or mistakes that
result from inexcusable neglect of available knowledge.
Our bitterest enemies, the devotees of a &ldquo;high-bred aristocracy,&rdquo;
could not charge us with the first; and as to
the second, the past furnishes no experience for our
guidance. We do not know just how much work this
complex human machine is capable of doing; nor indeed
do we know how to adjust the action of the different
parts, and to manage the repairs so as to get the best
possible work out of it. Some overstrain it, others take
needless trouble about the repairs. As yet the capacities
of human muscle and nerve have never been adequately
tested. We are carrying the experiments in this
matter farther than they have ever gone before. We
cannot know the full strength of a cord till it is broken;
but we grow cautious when we see that the fibres are
beginning to give way.</p>

<p>Our astonishing prosperity is due to the large total of
brain-activity that is being applied in the development
of the natural resources, industries, and social life of our
nation&mdash;a total to which women as well as men contribute,
and the poorer people as well as the richer.
That they are able to make this common contribution, is
due to the fact, that we educate not only men but
women, not only the rich but the poor; that they are
keenly stimulated to make it, is due to the natural resources
of the country, to the mobile conditions of society,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and to the peculiar system of educating all classes and
both sexes together, which conditions combine to afford
to the various individuals, inviting possibilities for acquiring
wealth and influence. Along with this tremendous
brain activity, a very large proportion of our people
are carrying on an unusual amount of muscular activity.
That is, our active brains multiply things to be done
faster than they supply us with mechanical contrivances
and organization in industry, to reduce muscular labor.</p>

<p>In looking at the conditions of English life we observe:</p>

<p><b>I.</b> Comparative repose, the absence of an exciting
hope and a hurried and worrying activity. A large part
of the nation attempt to lead nothing beyond a simple
animal life, putting their entire energies into animal
force, and using this animal force for the benefit of those
above them, almost as completely as the horse or the ox.
This statement is so true of the agricultural laborers as
to admit of very little palliation, and it is scarcely less
true of the unskilled working classes in the towns. In
all the lower ranks of society there are great obstacles to
advancement in position, because each plane of life is
crowded with its own members; because each class is
educated in schools where only children of that class are
found, and where the education is especially adapted to
that class&mdash;that is, to their industrial needs and to what
is expected in that grade of society&mdash;and does not fit them
for any other place in society. One-fifth of the nation
cannot read, and the education of the great majority of
the remainder, when not limited to the &ldquo;three R's,&rdquo;
does not go far enough to create a taste for reading books;
and, shut off as they have been from participation in political
life, they have too little interest in public concerns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
to read the newspapers. That is, as compared with our life,
the possibilities for advancement are limited, the average
education is of a low order, and the stimulus that comes
from an acquaintance with the habits of those above them
is absent. Nearly all the spurs to ambition are wanting,
and in consequence there is little tendency to do more work
than is necessary to keep along in the old ways. The skilled
artisans have in this matter of opportunity for advancement
more in common with the circumstances of our life.
This sphere is not overcrowded, but they, too, lack the
means for education and association with those above
them provided in our public schools.</p>

<p>The result of their better chances for improvement
shows itself with them in the same way as with us, in a
tendency to overwork, though, as we should expect, not
in the same degree. Complaints are made of the physical
deterioration of this class, and laws are enacted to limit
the working hours of children; and in the last session of
Parliament, Mr. Mundella introduced a bill to fix the
limit for women below that of men. The bill did not
pass, but it will be introduced again in the next session.</p>

<p>The large shopkeepers and manufacturers are, again,
more assimilated to us in their possibilities for rapid
changes in financial conditions; but at best they are a
small class, and efficient help is more easily attainable.
With us, as soon as a man becomes conscious that he has
good ability for work, he finds for himself an independent
place. Here, as a rule, there is no independent
place for him, and he is obliged to sell his ability to some
other man who has an independent footing. So that the
leader of a scheme is not only relieved from puzzling
over details, but a large part of the planning is done by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
able men in his employ, and he need give but little of
his time. As a rule, a man must be on a pretty high
platform to have much hope of crowding his way up
higher.</p>

<p><b>II.</b> The importance of health is a dominant idea in the
whole nation. This is probably due to the very permanent
impress given to English civilization by the feudal
system, to the demand made for the permanence of the
family, and for the production of warrior barons and
warrior retainers. The physical condition, that was formerly
a necessity, is now maintained as a matter of aristocratic
fashion and pride in ancestry. The higher classes
have nothing to do that demands a strong physique, but
they devote the best part of their energies to securing it,
and set up their own results and methods as a model
which the whole nation follow. As evidence of this
national interest in health, we may observe the number
of Public Health bills that come into Parliament, and it
is not strange that they get the most attention from the
Conservative side of the House. As farther confirmation
we observe the great number of holidays spent, not in
merrymaking, but in a stroll in the fresh air of the country,
and the fact that nearly all the families of the whole nation
make as regular provision for one or more &ldquo;outings&rdquo; in
the year, as they do for the extra wraps for the winter;
and still farther, that almost the poorest classes refuse to
buy bread and meat of second quality, not from luxurious
tastes, but from a belief that it is less healthful. This consideration
for health pervades all ranks of the nation.</p>

<p><b>III.</b> As conducive to the maintenance of health, we
find, first, remarkable regularity of habits, which is largely
due to the fixedness, or caste state of society, that
keeps people in the same grade of life into which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
are born; that is, in conditions where they have no
occasion to change their habits, and where they have
little opportunity for seeing any habits, except those to
which they conform. Children naturally fall into the
ways in which they are expected to go. This permanence
of conditions goes far to insure a degree of
regularity that almost converts habits into instincts.
Within the last few weeks, I have for the first time
heard an Englishman say that he had eaten too much.
Doubtless this mistake does sometimes occur, but the
fact that it puts one at discredit to acknowledge it, is
sufficient indication of the popular feeling respecting it.
A child, even, is seldom seen eating a bit of fruit, or a
bun, at other than the regular meals. Once I saw a
woman, in an Oxford street omnibus, eating a basket of
gooseberries, and so unusual was the sight, that I could
not help wondering if she were not some stray American.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in importance even before regularity of living
we should rank the athletic habits of the people, their
large amount of vigorous out-of-door exercise. The upper
classes are, by the customs of society, quite generally
excluded from productive industry. They follow the
custom of feudal times and live mostly in the country,
where walking, driving, riding, and country sports furnish
the chief employment and amusement. Children are
trained into habits of out-of-door exercise till they get
an appetite for it, as they have for their food, and it is
not unusual to hear an Englishwoman say, &ldquo;I would as
soon go without my lunch as without a walk of an hour
or an hour and a half in the day;&rdquo; and the habits of the
upper classes, as I have already intimated, percolate down
through all ranks of life. As contributing in no small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
degree to invite this open air exercise, we must include
the moderate and equable temperature, and the excellent
and attractive roads and walks.</p>

<p><b>IV.</b> Almost as the tap-root of this long-lived, hardy
race is the strong and universal desire for family permanence,
which makes the peculiar constitution that gives
the best promise of maintaining the family, the ideal
standard for the whole nation. Mothers know that their
daughters stand little chance of marrying an eldest son,
unless they have a well-developed physique, and daughters
are not slow in learning the same truth. This
necessitates a high physical ideal for the women, towards
which they consciously strive, outside of and above the
general national habits.</p>

<p>These considerations, the repose, the care for health,
the regularity of habits, the open air exercise, the demand
for a strong physique as security for the permanence
of the family, combine to produce a high average
of health in men and women alike. In looking into
the habits that more especially affect the health of the
women, we may separate society into two classes, drawing
just below the large retail traders, a line of division
which, as a rule, marks the distinction between
skilled and unskilled servants. In this upper division,
we find a nurse who has served an apprenticeship as
under nurse in the same grade of life, a cook who has
served as under cook, etc. Each servant understands
exactly the duties that belong to her sphere, that is, the
regimen in her branch of work, proper for a family in
that position.</p>

<p>Fashion says the women of the family should not only
do no money-earning work, but also no money-saving work.
In short, the best criterion of rank would be the degree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and naturalness with which they indulge an absolute
leisure.</p>

<p>Ostensibly they very rigidly obey this fashion, though
doubtless, in many cases, some dressmaking or plain
sewing is done somewhere out of sight. The plan is
for the mistress to spend half-an-hour in the morning in
giving her orders and looking over accounts; beyond this,
for the women of the family to be exempt from any real
household service, while all branches of sewing are to be
given to professional seamstresses. If the family lives
in town, the evenings are supposed to be very regularly
spent in social enjoyment; if they live in the country,
they fill in the time as best they can, after the late dinner.
But whether at home or away, the food and habits are
about the same, or, if there are late hours, the sleep is
made up in the morning. The children are in the hands
of a competent nurse, and from her they pass to a
governess, who looks after their physical habits as well
as their lessons. Few mistakes are likely to be made.
The regimen of habits for the children at the advancing
ages is well understood, and the success of the nurse or
governess in keeping her place depends upon her fidelity
in carrying them out. The children are trained into
these regular habits till they become appetites, and
seem to be laws of their nature.</p>

<p>In the lower division, the servants are less numerous
and less efficient. Mothers and daughters do a part, or
all, of the domestic work. But the baking, in most
parts of the country, and much of the sewing, is done
out of the house. More servants are employed than in
corresponding families with us, and altogether much less
work is included in the domestic occupations. In the
higher grades of this lower division, the education of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
girls continues till from fourteen to sixteen, and is carried
on either under a governess, or in small schools,
which are either boarding-schools or day schools. The
governesses are cheap, and the schools are cheap, and
there seems to be little choice between the two plans.</p>

<p>The girls have a little history, French, music, and
ornamental needlework. Below these upper grades,
girls are educated at the National schools, where, if they
remain long enough, they are taught the common
branches and plain needlework, moderately well.
Through the upper division of society, the education of
the girls continues till from seventeen to eighteen.
About half of their education, also, is given by governesses,
and the other half about equally in boarding
and day schools. Nearly all private schools are
small, rarely exceeding forty pupils, and giving an
average of from twenty to twenty-five. If there is but
one session of the school, it never exceeds four hours.
Great pains are taken not to have the schools change the
dietary and hygienic habits to which the girls are accustomed
at home. They either go home for their simple
midday dinner, or they dine at the school, and their
daily walks are provided for at home, or taken with a
governess at school. That is, there is an approved system
of habits for English girls, and these are rigidly
carried out, whether they are in a boarding-school or a
day school, or under a governess; and on the average,
either in the efficiency of the teaching, or the physical
results, there seems to be little choice between the three
plans. As to the amount of intellectual work accomplished,
no English person speaks well, nor indeed with
a moderate degree of censure.</p>

<p>About ten years ago, a Royal Commission was ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>pointed
to inquire into the condition of the education of
the country; and though the plan first contemplated, included
only boys' schools, the commissioners were later
instructed to extend their inquiry to girls' schools. The
report of this commission bore the most concurrent testimony,
that the girls' schools were much inferior to the
boys' schools. They complained that too many subjects
were attempted, too little thoroughness was attained;
that there was a disposition to limit the education too
largely to moral training; that much time was wasted
on music; arithmetic is spoken of as &ldquo;a weak point,&rdquo;
and mathematics, beyond this, as seldom attempted. I
have not space for the full consideration of the points
brought out by the commissioners. I give only enough
to show that the average and almost universal education
of English women is wholly of the old-time feminine
type&mdash;useful sewing, reading, writing, and religious instruction
for the girls of the lower classes; ornamental
needlework, music, modern languages, history, and English
composition for the girls of the higher classes. The
result is, as far as I have been able to judge, women who
are in a rare degree truthful, pure, and faithful to recognized
obligations, but, as a rule, their range of recognized
obligations is not very wide, and the subjects in
which they take an interest are very limited. Among
the lower classes men are said to seek society in the
beer-shops, and in the higher classes, at the clubs and
with their gentlemen friends, because they have little
companionship at home. The education is so different
that there is far less of companionship between men and
women than with us. Among the lower classes, great
wastefulness in the family economies is attributed to the
ignorance of the women. In the report of one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
meetings of the Social Science Congress, I find the statement
of a working man which, I am sure, expresses the
general feeling of the people of the country. In referring
to the want of education, and the consequent want of
the home-creating power among the women, he said:
&ldquo;The homes of our artisans are not nearly equal to the
work they execute, nor to the wages they earn.&rdquo; Among
the higher classes, I am disposed to believe, that nowhere
else can women be found so exactly fitted for the place
that the popular sentiment expects them to fill; in short,
that the handiwork of man shows no higher triumph of
skill in adapting its instrument to the purpose it is meant
to serve, than is seen in these moral, healthy, dignified,
orderly, executive English matrons; and though the
place they fill in the work of the world is not very large,
it is not strange that the conservative sentiment of the
country dreads to disturb the perfect balance.</p>

<p>The narrow intellectual attainments of these women
do not interfere very much with the general prosperity
of the family. Social position depends so largely upon
birth that no amount of intelligence or grace would enable
them to add very much to acquaintance or popularity;
and the servants are so skilful in their departments,
that the cleverest amateur could help them but
little.</p>

<p>All these women of the upper class uniformly write
and speak better English than we do. This is, perhaps,
quite as much due to the fact that they neither hear nor
read anything but good English, as to the careful drill
in English composition given in English schools. I am
speaking now of the intellectual attainments of the very
large proportion of the women in this upper class; but
among them are women, forming a considerable class,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
with whom we have very few to compare, and none to
equal the best. But these highly educated women
do not owe their attainments to the schools and governesses.
For the most part, they are the daughters of
learned men, by whom they have been taught, or they
have kept along with their brothers, who were getting
&ldquo;honors&rdquo; at the public schools and universities.
If women have once studied enough to create an intellectual
appetite, the privacy of English homes, especially
rural homes, furnishes great facilities for fostering it.
In regard to the school habits of girls under eighteen, I
quote the following statements, from the letter of a
teacher whose opinion and practice respecting these
matters would be received with as much authority as
that of any person in England:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>&ldquo;1st. We insist upon plenty of sleep. Our oldest
pupils go to bed at nine o'clock, the younger ones at
eight or half-past eight; and none rise before six. We
have no work before breakfast. We allow no later
hours, and no omission of out-door exercises when preparing
for examination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2d. We do not allow them to work immediately after
a meal, and after dinner we have no lessons (recitations),
except music and dancing, and no heavy study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3d. We regularly secure from one to two hours'
exercise in the open air, and we never keep them too
long at one occupation; but they must work vigorously
while they are about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4th. We make a great point of warm clothing and
careful ventilation of the rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5th. The intellectual work is not allowed to exceed
six hours per day; and if more than one hour is given
to music, the other work is diminished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;6th. Each girl is watched, and little ailments are
attended to.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This schedule represents the general practice in the
best schools and under the best governesses, and the
poorer schools differ mainly only in this, that they permit
more dawdling work. In a few schools, girls who
are a little older, or are exceptionally strong, are permitted
to exceed the six-hour limit of work; but the
general habit and feeling would be so much against it,
that, as a rule, the girl would not think of asking the
exceptional favor, and the teacher would not like the responsibility
of giving it. These rules, of course, are not
always thoroughly carried out; but with the careful home
discipline, the habits of obedience in girls, and the frank
intercourse and co-operation between parents and teachers,
it is safe to say a pretty strict observance of them is secured.</p>

<p>In regard to the care taken of girls during the few
years of their most rapid and culminating development
there are no rules uniformly observed, except that riding,
and very vigorous exercises, are prohibited on the occasions
when the system has less than its usual vigor.
Beyond this, the sixth rule given above covers the whole
ground. Whatever especial care is needed, is adapted to
individual cases. If paleness, languor, or unusual color
is observed, it is at once traced to its cause, and that
cause is removed. The schools that expect to get the
daughters from the best families must show the best
results in health. I quote the following from the letter
of a teacher whose large and varied experience in teaching
girls and women, and whose present educational
position, together with her especial knowledge of physiology,
makes her, I think, the best authority upon this
point: &ldquo;The result of my observation is, that Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>lish
mothers and schoolmistresses are very careful about
the health of girls between the ages of fourteen and
eighteen&mdash;in fact, rather disposed to be over-careful, and
to listen to the fears of medical men as to overwork. I
have known girls who suffered from unnatural conditions
of their functional organization, but I can safely say
these have never been brought on by mental work; they
have been induced by change of diet, such as girls
brought into town from the country must always experience,
or by coming into a sedentary life after an active
one, or from inattention to the action of the digestive
organs, but none from mental work. My own experience
would lead me most unhesitatingly to say that
regular mental occupation, <i>well arranged</i>, conduces
wholly to the health of a girl in every way, and that
girls who have well-regulated mental work are far less
liable to fall into hysterical fancies than those who have
not such occupation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following is from the letter of an English medical
lady educated on the Continent. &ldquo;The exercise of the
intellectual powers is the best means of preventing and
counteracting an undue development of the emotional
nature. The extravagances of imagination and feeling,
engendered in an idle brain, have much to do with the
ill-health of girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the evidence given by an eminent teacher before
the Royal Commission, in answer to the inquiry whether
there was not some danger of injuring the health of girls
between the ages of fourteen and sixteen by hard study,
I find the following: &ldquo;I think study improves their
health very much. I am sure great harm is often done
by hasty recommendation to throw aside all study, when a
temperate and wisely regulated mental diet is really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
required. They will not do nothing, but if they have
not wholesome, and proper, and unexciting occupations,
they will spend their time on sensational novels and
things much more injurious to health. Where I have
heard complaints about health as being injured by study,
they have proceeded from those who have done least
work at college. Indeed, I do not know of any case of a
pupil who has really worked, and whose health has been
injured. We have had complaints in a few cases where
the girls have been decidedly not industrious.&rdquo; In answer
to the inquiry, whether a girl's mind has not a tendency
to develop more rapidly than a boy's mind, and
whether, in consequence, there is not some risk of its
being overstrained, the reply is, &ldquo;decidedly, if the
teacher is not judicious; but supposing that sufficient
time is given to exercise, sleep, and recreation, then there
is no danger of its being overstrained by a teacher who
does not give work that the pupil does not understand.
For one girl in the higher middle classes who suffers
from overwork, there are, I believe, hundreds whose
health suffers from a feverish love of excitement, from
the irritability produced by idleness, frivolity, and discontent.
I am persuaded, and my experience has been
confirmed by experienced physicians, that <i>the want of
wholesome occupation lies at the root of the languid
debility of which we hear so much after girls leave
school</i>. I have been considering the question of health
somewhat of late, and I have made up from different
tables some statistics about literary ladies; from one
source I find that the average age to which they live is
over sixty-one, and from another sixty-eight; so that I do
not think learning can injure their health. Harm is
often done in this way: where a pupil goes to several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
different teachers, one of these, ignorant of the amount
required by other teachers, may give too much work, and
this can only be kept balanced by care from the head
teacher, who overlooks the whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In regard to whether girls from fourteen to eighteen
are able to do as much work as boys of corresponding
age, the experience is as yet too limited to give any
ground for positive opinion. The presumption, based
upon the difference in physical strength, is against it.
Still, girls, on the average, at the best girls' schools, are
now doing more work than the average of boys in the best
boys' schools. But these girls have better care than the
boys have, and none of them do the work of the leading
boys, who are looking forward to university honors.</p>

<p>All agree that girls have not less mental aptitude, but no
one, I am sure, would like to assert that it is safe to subject
girls to as much intellectual pressure as may be safely
applied to boys. One teacher of both boys and girls
confirmed my own observation, that there is often some
clog in the development of boys which, though less
positive in its action and less productive of a crisis, induces
a sort of physical torpor, which is not wholly
attributable to rapid growth, as it often appears when
the growth may be the very reverse of rapid; against
this a boy may be pressed without much danger to his
health, but not without liability to give him a distaste for
study, thus showing that we are making a demand for
an amount of mental force which he has not ready at
hand to give. There is, however, but one opinion upon
this point&mdash;that the least safe thing to do for girls at this
nervously critical and mentally excitable period is, to
allow them time to indulge and feed their fancies, or to
grow weary of themselves; that mental work is as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
healthful as food, but, like the food, needs careful regulation;
and that the health of women would be vastly
improved by increasing the school work in degree, and by
continuing it beyond the present term, chiefly as a matter
of employment to the women in the upper classes.
Among the lower classes, it would be a means of enabling
them to secure more sanitary arrangements in their
homes, and, in general, of enabling them to get better
results from their annual expenditures. The usual practice
in Germany, by which Dr. Clarke confirms his theory,
is not the usual practice in England, and there would be
great unwillingness on the part of English people to
accept it as a general rule. Experienced teachers,
women physicians, philanthropic men physicians, and
wise mothers, are, as I have said, more afraid of an undue
development of the emotional nature in these critical
years, than of overtaxing the intellectual powers; and it
is doubtless true that while very few of the girls and
women in the upper classes overwork, a very large
number suffer in health from the absence of interesting
and absorbing employment. In Germany and America
the circumstances are different&mdash;in the former, girls have
more domestic occupations, and in the latter we have to
guard, not so much against the depressing influence of
idleness, as against the temptation to social excesses,
from which energetic school-work seems to be the
best shield. But even here, in England, I have found a
few thinking, active women who, judging from their
individual cases, had come upon Dr. Clarke's theory for
themselves, only, instead of limiting it to girlhood they
would extend it through womanhood, calling these
periods of repose the natural Sunday in a woman's life,
during which, if rest of body and mind was indulged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
there succeeded a marked renewal or awakening of
power&mdash;but this is an exceptional view in England.</p>

<p>Two movements are going on side by side in this country
to improve the education of women. One aims to
make the ordinary school-work more thorough, the other to
extend this school-work into later years of life. In 1858
Cambridge University established a system of &ldquo;Local
Examinations&rdquo; in various parts of the country, for boys
or schools of boys who wished to avail themselves of
this test for their work. There were two of these examinations,
the &ldquo;Junior Examination,&rdquo; for boys between
the ages of thirteen and sixteen, and the &ldquo;Senior Examination,&rdquo;
for those between sixteen and eighteen. The
effect of this spur upon boys and boys' schools was so
apparent that the university, at the request of a large
number of women interested in education, in 1863,
opened these examinations to girls of corresponding
ages, and it was the glaring defects discovered by these
examinations that led the Royal Commission so readily
to extend its inquiry to girls' schools. The number of
girls' schools, and girls studying under governesses
who avail themselves of these examinations, has steadily
and rapidly increased, and the results have been such as
to leave no doubt in regard to the mental acumen
of girls as compared with boys. These Local Examinations
subjected the girls to precisely the same examinations
as the boys, but the subjects in which both boys
and girls were examined did not follow the precise
curriculum of Eton, Harrow, and Rugby; that is, the
university, in making up its list of subjects for examination,
instead of adapting itself to the long established
lines of study for boys, conformed rather to the modern
opinion in regard to the best system of education.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of this experiment in examining girls grew a
movement to secure a higher education for women, which
soon separated into two sections, the one subsequently
embodying its views in Girton College, the other in the
&ldquo;University Examinations&rdquo; for women above the age of
eighteen. The two parties agreed upon these points&mdash;that
intellectual development takes place in men and
women in the same manner, and that the methods that
would be best for the one are also best for the other;
and that, while the methods at present made use of for
girls are wholly inadequate, the standard methods applied
in the education of boys and men are by no means in accordance
with the best educational opinion of the time.
But the friends of Girton College said, &ldquo;Admitting
these defects in the masculine system, it is, nevertheless,
the existing system; it has precedent and popular sentiment
in its favor; its standards are the accepted standards
for educational measurement; and the education of women
will be at a disadvantage, in inferior repute, so long as we
test it by a different standard&mdash;that is, we can never get
full recognition for the intellectual work of women until
we test it by the standards accepted for men; and it
seems to us that we shall advance the education of
women most successfully by falling into the existing
routine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other party said: &ldquo;We will not waste our energy
in crystallizing into a form that is not the best, and that
evidently cannot long keep its place in the education of
men; we will start upon a plan consistent with the most
enlightened educational opinion, and by our results will
secure favor for our methods, and respectability for our
standards.&rdquo; Girton College, now located at Cambridge,
holds simultaneous examinations with those of the uni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>versity,
and uses the university examination questions.
The number of its students is small, and they are for the
most part those who are looking forward to teaching as
a means of support.</p>

<p>By the second, and what seems to be considerably the
stronger party, four years ago lectures were instituted in
various parts of the country, to prepare women for the
University Higher Examinations. The plan of these
examinations and lectures is something like what I understand
to be the plan at the German Universities.
There is no definite curriculum connected with them.
They cover a wide range of subjects, each candidate making
her selection, and preparing herself for examination
in one or more specific subjects, and, if successful, receives
a certificate of proficiency in those, except that certain
subjects must be passed before a certificate is awarded
for others.</p>

<p>To meet a widely preferred demand, Cambridge University
has recently opened these &ldquo;Higher Examinations
for Women,&rdquo; to men; and &ldquo;mixed classes,&rdquo; as they are
called, are now being formed. The university pledges
itself to supply the lecturers, provided classes of a certain
size are formed in towns sufficiently adjacent to be
grouped together. Under this last extension of its educational
advantages, the University proposes that, in
each place, a lecture on one subject shall be held at some
hour in the middle of the day most convenient for
women to attend; and one on another subject shall be held
in the evening, with reduced fees, for the benefit of the
working classes. Each lecture is open to any one who
will pay the fees; but, as a rule, the higher classes
would go to the day lectures, and the lower classes to
the evening lectures. To supplement these lectures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
which in each subject occur but once a week, in each
of a group of three towns, what is called a &ldquo;class&rdquo; is
held on a second day, when, by the payment of a small
additional fee, any one can go for further instruction
upon any point which he was not able to grasp from the
lecture. The lectures recommend a course of reading,
and suggest subjects for investigation, just as is done by
the lectures in the university. These examinations, as
I understand, are considered as severe as the examinations
for the same subjects in preparation for the B.A.
degree at the university. The plan is to carry systematic
instruction in the branches of university education
into all the large towns, and to keep it at a cost that
can be afforded by women and working men.</p>

<p>I have spoken only of the Cambridge University Examinations;
but, though Cambridge has taken the lead
in this work, the other universities have followed along
at more or less remote intervals, and the London University
has, here as elsewhere, placed its standards above
those of the others. The present system looks something
like an itinerant university; but no one can predict
just what it will become. All this work is simply experimental.
Plans are adopted to meet the present
exigency, and new ones are at any time engrafted.
But a few strongly-set tendencies are unmistakable,
old forms are giving way, education is working its way
down below the rich, men and women are coming together
in their intellectual work, and the notion of
&ldquo;finishing&rdquo; an education sometime between twelve
and twenty-three, promises to be forgotten.</p>

<p>The elasticity of this more German system, into which
English education is drifting, will obviate the difficulty
so much complained of in the English university system,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
that of forcing all students, irrespective of the varying
mental and physical powers, through a definite course of
study in a definite period of time.</p>

<p>Opportunities for instruction are offered. Students
choose the subjects, devote as much time to them as they
like, present themselves at the annual examinations if
they choose, and when they choose.</p>

<p>The university promises to provide good instruction,
to test the thoroughness of the work of all who desire
the test, and to award certificates of success to all
who come up to its standards; and these certificates will
doubtless eventually be able to sum up into degrees, or
else degrees will lose their especial value, and be abandoned.
Limiting the ages of the candidates for the
several examinations, though seemingly a little arbitrary,
aims to avoid encouraging too precocious advancement,
while there is a willingness to make exceptions in favor
of pupils who are shown to be exceptionably able.</p>

<p>I do not find, in the English schools, and certainly
there is not in the universities, a rigid practice of giving
daily marks for the work. The teachers lecture, and
the pupils take notes.</p>

<p>In the schools these notes are carefully examined, and
the pupils who give evidence of deficient knowledge of
the subject, are sent to a leisure governess, for especial
instruction. At the universities, the only tests are the
examinations, and at the schools, the examinations are
chiefly relied upon for promotions. This plan allows
pupils of irregular power, and varying health, to admit
these same irregularities into their work, without great
prejudice to the total credit of their results. With
these two systems of allowing choice in the number and
kind of subjects pursued, and of testing the work by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
examinations, rather than daily records, provision is
made for the differences of power and aptitude between
different students, and for the occasional variations in
physical vigor, which are likely to occur with any except
those who possess the strongest constitutions&mdash;and this,
with the athletic habits and general care for health that
pervades English life, is likely to prove a pretty good
safeguard against excessive mental work for both men
and women; though, of course, individual cases occur
where, driven by ambition or necessity, one incautiously
puts more strain upon his powers than they can bear.</p>

<p>The English sentiment in regard to the advisability of
encouraging young women to pursue precisely the same
course of study as young men, would be expressed in
this way: &ldquo;It is rarely advisable for any two young
men to pursue an identical course of study. The chief
aim of education is to develop the mental faculties, to
enable us to observe accurately, and judge correctly; the
practices that secure these results are various; one set
of practices may be better adapted for the training of
one mind, and another set better adapted for training
another mind, and no one set will fail to give good
results, if pursued with energy. In the choice, we are,
as a rule, safest to follow the individual inclination. As
yet, women have been so limited in opportunities, that
they have had little chance to discover their mental inclinations,
either as a class, or as individuals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement would, I think, go no farther. The
question of co-education has as yet scarcely come into the
popular mind. Small experiments, prompted usually by
convenience, have been made, so far as I have heard,
with uniform success, and the practice is making its way
into the higher education of the country. Women are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
already admitted to the Political Economy class, and
one or two other classes in University College, London;
as I have said, the lectures and classes organized under
the recent plan of Cambridge University, for carrying
university education into the towns, are open to men
and women in common; and the various governing
bodies are now discussing the question of admitting
women to degrees in London University, to both classes
and degrees in Queen's College, Belfast, and to classes
in Owen's College, Manchester, and a bill is likely to be
introduced into the next session of Parliament, to empower
all the universities to extend their privileges to
women, if they desire to do it.</p>

<p>The time-honored precedents are at present against
the plan, but the practice of these highest authorities
will soon turn opinion in its favor. The lack of funds to
educate women, the rapidly growing feeling that men
and women are at present too much separated by social
customs and differences in tastes, and the belief that it
would promote a higher moral tone among men, are
uniting to produce a strong current of interest and feeling
in favor of the system. Young men at the English
universities rarely overwork. Popular feeling, fashion,
respectable sentiment&mdash;call it as one will&mdash;is all against
considering health secondary to anything. A few evenings
ago I chanced to be talking with a university young
man, who was at home for the holidays. I asked,
&ldquo;About how many hours do your good students work?&rdquo;
The reply was, &ldquo;Rarely more than seven. A few of
the hardest reading men&mdash;those aiming at fellowships&mdash;who
do not take more than two hours for exercise, work
a little longer; and they work longer just before the
examinations.&rdquo; When I smiled at the evident contempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
thrown upon the &ldquo;two hours for exercise,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;You do not think two hours enough for exercise, do
you?&rdquo; In all the best English schools, either for boys
or girls, the plan is to work with vigor, and play with
vigor. There are hours enough for sleep to secure good
rest; then work is arranged to give variety, and confined
within moderate limits of time, so that if a pupil does
extra work, he does it by extra intensity.</p>

<p>After leaving school, English girls in the upper and
middle classes give more time to society than American
girls do; that is, society is the regular evening occupation,
and in the day-time there is little to do but to recover
from the previous evening.</p>

<p>But society is relieved of a large part of the excitability
that attends it with us. The wealth and social position
of the family and the ingenious tact of mammas, as a
rule, win the husbands, and the daughter needs only to
be in sight. It is not at all rare to go to an evening
party and know no one but the host and hostess, and as
introductions are rarely given, one has only to look about
and go home when she is tired. At a dinner-party she
is told the name of the one who leads her to the table,
but she is always at liberty to talk as little as she likes,
and she offends the social taste if she talk very much.
English mothers of this class have very little to do except
to give birth to their children, and go through the established
routine of dinners and calls. If there is any complaint
respecting the work they have to do, it is of the
deficit, and the inferior health of the women between
their school-days and their wifehood is to be accounted
for by the want of occupation and independence. They
have no more to do, and no more chance to exercise
their wills, than during the first six years of their lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>After the early years of marriage the health almost
uniformly improves, and by the time they are forty or
forty-five, they have usually attained a ripe perfection of
health, which gives them a physical superiority over the
men for the remaining twenty-five or thirty-five years of
their lives, and also over the women who have remained
unmarried.</p>

<p>The sentiments that pervade, and the circumstances
that control our life, and the habits they engender, are
very different. It is not possible for us to have habits
whose regularity shall so nearly convert them into instincts
as is the case with the English. We have to make
our lives out of the conditions about us, and these conditions
change year by year. The opportunities for acquiring
wealth and social distinction are so great that
they stimulate us to great exertion.</p>

<p>Our schools give all classes an opportunity for education,
and by associating the poorer classes with the wealthier,
implant in the former, tastes for the life of the
latter, and a keen ambition to attain it, and this imposes
upon the latter the necessity of struggling to maintain
their position. All our men are over-active; our girls
are educated along with the boys, and they not only acquire
equal mental power, but common intellectual
tastes. Men and women are able to be, and are, the
companions of each other.</p>

<p>Our girls have a longing for an active life not felt by
the girls in any other country. Wives share the hopes,
fears, and anxieties of their husbands. They are eager
to gain wealth and friends as a means to improve their
social position. They economize in the family expenditure;
they employ few or no servants, and do plain sewing,
dressmaking, and millinery. Education and a varied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
experience gives our women a &ldquo;faculty&rdquo; for doing anything,
and there is no national sentiment in the matter
of either health or respectability to keep then from doing
everything. As fast as the daughters grow up, they are
drawn into this ceaseless activity. Besides the lessons
there is house-work in the morning, and sewing till into
the late evening.</p>

<p>We are a rich nation, but we are not a nation of rich
individuals. Domestic service is expensive, and of poor
quality, for no one is willing to occupy the position of a
menial who can find anything else to do.</p>

<p>The intelligence of our women, combined with the
necessity in our society of producing a good personal
impression, together with the habit of applying their intelligence
to the construction and arrangement of articles
of dress, have developed among us a very high order of
taste in these matters, and the skilled labor that can satisfy
it, is necessarily very costly.</p>

<p>Our women spend all they can afford in buying these
materials, and save, in using their own intelligence and
hands in making them up.</p>

<p>Very few, in considering the work of our women, take
into account the real brain-power expended in this triple
combination of economy, taste, and execution. Emerson
somewhere in his <i>English Traits</i> says, referring to
the English aristocracy:&mdash;&ldquo;It is surprising how much
brain can go into fine manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be very pertinent to say of American women,
&ldquo;It is surprising how much brain-work can go into fine
dressing,&rdquo; and our girls join their mothers in this worry
and work at a very early age. Passing from work to
society, the strain upon our women is no less. Social
gatherings occur irregularly, have irregular hours, and an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
irregular regimen of food, and every one feels a keen
stimulus to be both agreeable and brilliant. English
faces at a party look as they do at church, and as they do
at Madame Tussaud's. Contrast with them the smiles,
luminous eyes, and pretty cant or toss of the head of
the carefully-dressed American woman, and think of
the work to be done the next day.</p>

<p>In place of a health-seeking instinct in America, we
have a feeling which says, &ldquo;I do not mind how hard a
strain I have, provided I can hold out till I get through
it.&rdquo; We are too much employed to think much of the
discomfort of moderate fatigue and ill-health. Neither
have we sufficient feeling respecting the permanence of
the family to lead us to plan for a succession of descendants.
An American says, &ldquo;I had rather have forty-five
or fifty years of active, satisfactory life, than sixty or
seventy years of a comfortable, dawdling existence;&rdquo;
and, if we look at the case only as it affects himself, we
cannot especially condemn the reasoning, but when we
consider the constitution that this overstrained life bequeathes
to the children, it assumes a different aspect.</p>

<p>Being accustomed to see an attenuated, sickly physique
in our leading and best-bred families, the eye is mis-educated;
we establish a false ideal for women, and become
comparatively indifferent to a fine physique in men.
Men do not marry with a view of founding or continuing
a family name, and their sentiment of gallantry inclines
them to be fond of protecting a weak woman.</p>

<p>Irregular habits are to some degree a necessity with
us, and the greatest misfortune is, that we get used to
the irregularity, and take little pains to avoid it. We
have some rules in regard to diet and digestion, but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
are for the most part practised only by those who have
acquired ills, and are not very frequently applied in the
rearing of children.</p>

<p>The extremes of climate, and our uninviting roads,
discourage open air exercise, and comparatively few have
much time to go out.</p>

<p>Our children do some more work at school than English
children, and they have a good deal more of their
time wasted in our system of text-books and &ldquo;recitations,&rdquo;
a word not known in England in the sense in
which we use it, which requires that the able and conscientious
pupils of the class shall look on while the
weak and indolent ones are being drilled; which plan,
judging from my own experience at school and college,
I feel justified in saying, involves for them not only a
waste of from one to three hours a day, but a fatigue
fully or nearly equal to the same amount of time spent
in study. We put great pressure upon class rank, the
value of which is determined by the daily marks. This
forces pupils into a very high degree of regularity in
their work; at the same time it has most effect upon the
most conscientious pupils; if it does not lead them to
overdo in work, it is liable to make them overworry
about the work, and girls suffer far more from this overworry
than boys.</p>

<p>In considering the relation between the health of the
country and the education, the few women who have
had a university course of study need not be taken
into account. Most of them have reached an age when
people are allowed to decide upon their own habits, and,
as a matter of fact, these habits have been determined
by stern necessities, by the hard, money-getting circumstances
that surround women, rather than by choice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
At Antioch College, with few exceptions, they were
women who were looking forward to self-support, and
who were borrowing the whole, or a part of the money
required for their current expenses, on the promise of
repaying it with the wages of their subsequent work.</p>

<p>Many of them were absent a part of the year, teaching,
were giving private lessons, or were teaching
classes in the preparatory school connected with the
college; and, if a few hours of leisure were left after
all this employment, they were likely to be spent upon
extra studies; aside from this, they did their own
sewing, and many of them boarded themselves. They
often overworked, but it was the necessities of their
lives that were driving them, and not the curriculum of
Antioch College. However, if the English feeling respecting
health, and the means of preserving it, prevailed
in our country, these mistakes would less frequently
occur.</p>

<p>Unquestionably our whole nation needs some escape
from its exhausting activities. We need either less
work, or some more skilful combination of the different
varieties of work, that will secure us more rest, and,
except in a small circle of wealth, our women, as a rule,
need this rest more than the men. We need repose,
freedom from anxiety perhaps, more even than freedom
from work. How are we to get it?</p>

<p>We cannot have back the caste condition of society, nor
would we desire it. We cannot stop the progress of our
system of free education, nor would we be willing to do
it. We cannot set aside the practice and belief in equality
of education for men and women; men would not
like it, and women would not permit it. There are many
things that can be done that will conduce to the desired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
result, and the best among them for women is, to organize
women's work.</p>

<p>The education is not a mistake; the fault lies in this,
that the industries of women have not kept pace with
their advancing education. They have been exempt
from bread-winning to a degree unknown in the old
countries, and the average education is far higher than
exists elsewhere among women. They have startled the
world a little by attempting a few of the intellectual industries
hitherto monopolized by men, and, though the opening
of the professions, or, indeed, all lines of human industry,
to women, is not to be undervalued, of almost infinitely
greater importance is the application of scientific
economical principles to the large sphere of work already
in their hands, and which is remaining in a disastrously
undeveloped condition, just because it is in their hands.
The low rate of female wages leaves them the monopoly
of it, and they dawdle along in the ways of their grandmothers,
out of sight behind the advancing masculine
industries.</p>

<p>It is surprising to foreigners that in the application of
the division of labor principle to domestic work, we are
actually behind them, that we still permit such excess of
work and excess of waste in our domestic arrangements.
Cooking and sewing, the two leading branches of domestic
industry, are with them to a very large degree trades,
while nursing and laundry-work are trades in a far greater
degree than with us.</p>

<p>Upon this point of the organization of domestic industry,
though one that I have long been considering, I can
do no better than to refer to the suggestive article of Mrs.
E. M. King in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for December,
1873. The substance of this article was presented at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
last meeting of the British Association. The Right
Honorable Mr. Forster occupied the chair, and at the
close of the discussion remarked that he should not like
to give up his private home. Now, it is not to be supposed
that Royalty would at once give up its palaces to rush
into the society of a set of co-operative homes, nor that
Right Honorables with &ldquo;large fortunes&rdquo; would make
close bargains in domestic service. The scheme at the
outset would recommend itself only to those whose incomes
did not provide an adequate supply for their
wants on the present wasteful plan of domestic life, and
who saw in this system a means to secure larger returns
for their outlay of money, and it could advance in favor
only as it fulfilled this promise.</p>

<p>Seeing a trustworthy principle of economy in the plan,
the <i>Spectator</i> turned pale, and declaimed against the destruction
of the time-honored English homes; and London
builders began to consult Mrs. King in regard to the
house arrangements for carrying out her plan.</p>

<p>There will be no difficulty in preserving the desired
privacy for the family, though the wearying privacy of
many English homes leads not a few to think it is not
worth preserving in the English degree.</p>

<p>Adopt and apply the plan of which Mrs. King suggests
an outline, press the division of labor principle in woman's
work as far as it will go, and the wives and daughters
who make our homes will not break down from overwork.</p>

<p>The readiest and surest corrective for the excessive
greed of our girls for society is to carry on the system of
co-education. This supplies a temperate gratification to
the social appetites, induces girls to remain longer in
school, and to do more thorough work, thus securing
to them other sources of pleasure than social amuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ments
and the companionship of friends. The process
of co-education tends to develop a well-balanced character,
and to put into it a trustworthy ballast, which
American girls cannot afford to do without. For confirmation
of this, one need only read the reports of any school
judiciously managed on this plan, or he need only use his
eyes in comparing the past school days with those of girls
educated in the high schools and private schools of our
Western cities. Of course girls of the present average
habits and inherited tendencies must not be pressed up
to quite the same degree of work that may be safely
required of their brothers, who have fewer domestic
demands upon their time, more out-of-door exercise, a
freer style of dress, and, in general, healthier habits of life.
Many a girl who takes especial care of herself&mdash;and, as a
rule, the able girls do this&mdash;or who has especial care from
her mother, may safely do what the best boys do without
especial care.</p>

<p>But so long as girls require from one hour and a half
to three hours a day, to be, or to develop themselves into,
the conventional girl, and boys require only about one-third
of that time to get themselves up into the conventional
pattern for a boy, girls must either be superior to
boys to begin with, or they must economize their power
better, if they are able to do as much school-work in a
year as boys; that is, if girls must consume power in all
the ways that constitute the approved specialties of girls,
they cannot do the whole work of boys without doing
much more than boys do.</p>

<p>Whether the future has possibilities for girls that
will give no occasion for this deficit of available power
for school-work, it is impossible to say. Oberlin College
and Michigan University report that the young women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
are no more frequently absent from their classes on
account of ill-health than the young men. But it
must be remembered that the women are few in number,
and in some important respects more above the
average of women than the young men are above the
average of young men. Especially in the respect of a
prudent care for their health their necessities have
made them wise&mdash;and this will be the character of most
of the women who go to college for some time to come.
Our schools, too, show as high an average of work for
girls as for boys, but this must not be wholly put down
to equal resources. Girls, on the average, are more
anxious for approval than boys are, and if work is assigned
them, in spite of disadvantages they are quite
as likely to do it as boys are.</p>

<p>Nor are we to suppose that the best average education
for the present girls would show just the same average
in direction as the best average education for boys.</p>

<p>Oberlin, the oldest experiment in co-education at
college, arranges its plans with especial reference to
the average differences between the quantity and direction
of the school-work at present demanded for men and
women. It has its &ldquo;Ladies' Course,&rdquo; as well as its University
Course. The young women are allowed to
pursue the University Course, though out of the four or
five hundred young women who are in attendance, those
who have taken degrees give only an average of about
two in a year. At Antioch there was a large range of
optional subjects, and among them was Greek, which
the Western young men were about as much disposed
to omit as the young women. The curriculums of the
Western high schools have also a wide optional margin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>The growing educational sentiment is setting aside
the old idea that it is well for all boys to pursue the same
line of study, independent of tastes, and past and prospective
circumstances in life; and another still more
pernicious notion is sure soon to give way, that boys and
young men, of whatever physical and brain power, are
to be put through a definite course of study in just the
same time. No one thinks it much of a guarantee for a
man's scholarship that he holds an A.B. or an A.M.
degree. This only assures us that he has spent four
years at some institution that has a right to confer these
degrees. When our system of schools and colleges is
sufficiently flexible to meet the varying needs of boys
and young men, we shall not find that it lacks anything
to adapt it to the varying needs of boys and girls, or men
and women. Men furnish us with examples through the
whole scale of physical power and mental aptitude, and
so do women.</p>

<p>The best girls will at least have no difficulty in carrying
on three subjects of study, while the best boys carry
on four; and girls not only can, but as a rule do, remain
longer at school than the boys. It would be well, too,
to give more credit to the specialties of girls in the
schools. I can think of nothing else that would conduce
so much to the thorough and satisfactory study of music
as to give it an optional place in our school curriculums.</p>

<p>Doubtless the best plan would be to give girls a moderate
amount of home work along with their school-work&mdash;that
is, to develop a united domestic and intellectual
taste. With the habit once formed of making this
combination of pursuits, we should be much surer of
their continuing their intellectual cultivation through life.
If this could be done, they ought, as a rule, to be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
to do more than men do in the last fifteen or twenty
years of their lives.</p>

<p>The results of our experiments in co-education have
so far indicated that there is no difference between the
intellectual tastes of men and women. This I do not
accept as final. The prevailing sentiment in society,
that girls cannot do all that boys do, and that they are a
little in discredit because they cannot, has given them
an undue stimulus to prove their power by experiment;
and it is well that they have done it, to silence the doubts.
Moreover, the women who were looking forward to the
higher places of intellectual industry occupied by men,
had to test themselves by the standards established for
their rivals. And the same may be said of all the
money-getting pursuits for women, outside of the lines
of domestic service and sewing; in order to get any
ground, they have had to fall into men's ways, so that
their work could be tested by men's standards. To
prove that they were the equals of men, they have had
to prove that they were the equals of both women and
men; they have had to learn and to be all that other
women know and are, and, in addition, to equal men in
the points where men surpass women; while their masculine
rivals are exempt from all the demands for time
and thought bestowed upon the specialties of women.</p>

<p>When women can gain authority for their own standards&mdash;the
right to work in a woman's way, tested only
by the quantity and quality of their results, that is, by
the value of their work to society&mdash;money-earning women
will not break down in health any more than money-earning
men do, nor will the total of their work appear
smaller than the total of men's work. There is no intrinsic
reason why women's work, done in women's way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
should have less commercial value and creditable recognition
than men's work, done in men's way. Poems
are in as good repute and sell as well as books of philosophy,
and house decorators are as much in demand, and
are paid as well as architects. The present industries of
women are undeveloped; there is among them, as yet,
no sphere for skilled, high-class work, and many of the
industries that naturally belong to women have been
developed by men, and are possessed by men. The
wages of women are low, because there are too many
workers for the range of work they are attempting to do.</p>

<p>The industries that are exclusively in their hands are
almost wholly at a stage where intelligent labor is not
required, and so few of the industries that have been
developed by men are open to them, that, owing to the
great competition, even the skilled work of women, as
yet, commands but a low price. They want more work,
and especially a larger amount of intelligent or skilled
work. They must both organize and develop, by the
application of the division of labor principle, the work
they already have, and they must win from men a part
of their work.</p>

<p>But they can make their way into the industries occupied
by men, only by doing the work in men's way, and
underbidding men in wages. When they once get
undisputed possession, they can and do apply their own
methods. Mr. Mundella's Bill, to which I have already
referred, will, as is believed, if it become a law, put a
great obstacle in the way of their progress. It is to the
interest of the mill-owners to keep their machinery at
work as many hours as they can, and if men will work
ten hours a day, while women are prohibited from working
more than nine and a half, men will be employed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
preference to women, even with the disadvantage of
larger wages. But, fortunately, it is said, the women
cannot be wholly driven out. In some branches of the
work they do so much better than the men, that even if
this reduction of hours should be enforced, the mill-owners
will still find it to their advantage to employ
women.</p>

<p>The women in these special lines have already proved
the value of women's work done in women's way. I
believe women have also got a similar recognition in
some branches of the watchmaking trade; and in teaching,
they have already proved the superiority of their
methods. They get forward slowly, because of the
great strain required in using men's methods to get the
gates opened to them, and Mr. Mundella's Bill would
put an extra bar across the gates. The wages are kept
low along the line of their advance, because an army of
laborers follow along so fast in the rear. I have no fear
but that women will stand a fair chance with men in the
industries of the world, when they once get a free and
open way into them, and learn to apply scientific principles
as men do. Fine manipulation in a hand is fast
coming to be as valuable a quality as strength.</p>

<p>To secure the changes that all wise or good feeling
must desire for women, many things are needed; and as
I have said, first of all, we need organization in domestic
work, in order to reduce the quantity, to save waste
in materials, and to develop a better quality of work,
by making the different departments into trades or
skilled industries&mdash;thus we must put our cooking under
the care of chemists and physiologists, and in a variety
of ways provide work for wives and daughters suited to
their intelligence, and relieved of coarse drudgery. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
need women physicians, employed by the year, whose
duty and interest it will be to keep the family in health,
and thus avoid the occasions for curing them when they
are ill; and here is the safeguard for our girls&mdash;a person
familiar with both the home life and school life of
the children, and whose interest would forbid her to
yield either to the weak affection of the mother, or the
thoughtless ambition of the teacher. The familiar conversations
that would naturally spring up between competent
women physicians on the one side, and mothers, children,
and cooks on the other, would contribute vastly to the
improved diet and general sanitary habits of the family;
and open a way to more rapid progress in determining
the relation between different varieties of food and peculiarities
in the mental and physical powers and appetites.
We need creditable wages, given in employments for
women other than teaching, in order to save our schools
from being the receptacle of all women who have occasion
to earn money. We need some half-time system
in our schools, to provide for the pupils who have less
health or less time; and also to secure for them teachers
from a higher class of families, who find all-day
work uncomfortably exhausting or confining. We need
to raise the scale of feminine wages, in order to invite
the application of time-saving inventions in women's
work, as they are now employed in men's work. We
need a wider range of work for women.</p>

<p>As a means to all this we need, and as the result of all
of it we shall get, a recognition of feminine methods
and standards, as well as of masculine methods and
standards. If the specialties in the culture of women
are worth preserving, it is because they have value;
many of them, I am certain, have real value, and others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
have a current value, so that we cannot at present dispense
with them&mdash;if they have value, when we have
a free and well-adjusted labor market, they will command
their price. For bringing about these changes, we
must have well-educated, wise women.</p>

<p>Our women, in matters of dress, are more completely
the slaves of fashion than the women in any other civilized
country. This is due to the necessity they feel for
making a good personal impression. Their family position
does comparatively little, either for or against them.
They marry, or get forward in life, chiefly by making
themselves personally agreeable. When we give them
other means of influence than this, when we secure to
them industrial and political power, these personal considerations
will diminish in importance, and their minds
will naturally turn away from them.</p>

<p>There are many things awry, many things that need
to be improved, but we must be wise in our methods.</p>

<p>We cannot exactly imitate the English, nor do I believe
it is worth doing. The Malthusian chorus of
political economists suggests the notion that a nation
may be over-physical. We want health for ourselves,
and healthy tendencies for our descendants. Beyond this,
we want to send our surplus force to the brain.</p>

<p>None can appreciate the weight attaching to the words
of a distinguished member of an honored profession, as
well as the younger members of that same profession.
They know something of the toil needed to achieve a
worthy reputation, and of the talent implied by the capacity
for toil. They know how to discriminate between
the careful opinions of mature and deliberate judgment,
and the headlong assertions of rash busy-bodies and
amateurs. They understand, because they feel, the inevitable
esoterism that must persist at the kernel of all
democracies, unless these degenerate into mere rabble
and intellectual mob: they are the last, therefore, to
maintain that one person's word is as good as another's;
that common sense is competent to solve all questions;
that freedom of thought means the right of all to think
as they please. Knowing, on the contrary, the extreme
complexity of all problems, and the facility with which
the most upright judgment may become warped in meditating
upon them, they are prepared to exact a long apprenticeship
in thinking from those who assume the right
to think in public, and a minute familiarity with facts
from those who undertake to defend any opinion in re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>gard
to them. Whenever a writer, by previous and just
reputation, offers conclusive proof of such apprenticeship,
familiarity, and ability to judge, his conclusions must be
examined with care, and disputed, if at all, with respect.</p>

<p>Yet such examination is as essential to the interests of
truth as is the just ascendancy that may be acquired by
repeated success in the difficult task of investigation.
Those who reject it as superfluous or impertinent, or who
decry opposition as shallow obstinacy, are always those
least competent to measure the weight of arguments on
either side, and whose approval of authority must be as
valueless as the dissent from authority certainly <i>may</i> be.</p>

<p>The singular avidity with which the press and the
public have seized upon the theme discussed in Dr.
Clarke's book on <i>Sex in Education</i>, is a proof that this
appeals to many interests besides those of scientific truth.
The public cares little about science, except in so far as
its conclusions can be made to intervene in behalf of
some moral, religious, or social controversy.</p>

<p>In the present case, a delicate physiological problem
has become as popular as theories on epigenesis, spontaneous
generation, or Darwinian evolution, and for an
analogous reason. As the latter are expected to decide
in the doctrines of natural or revealed religion, so the
former is supposed to have a casting vote in regard to
the agitating claims for the extension of new powers to
women. On the one hand, the inspiration of scripture,
on the other, the admission of women to Harvard, is at
stake, and it is these that lend the peculiar animus and
animation to the discussion. In both polemics, arguments
are not accepted because they are demonstrated,
but enlisted because they are useful; ranged with others
recruited from the most distant quarters, with nothing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
common but the regiment into which they are all thrust,
to be hurled against a common enemy.</p>

<p>A remarkable change has taken place in the tone of
habitual remark on the capacities and incapacities of
women. Formerly, they were denied the privileges of an
intellectual education, on the ground that their natures
were too exclusively animal to require it. To-day, the
same education is still withheld, but on the new plea that
their animal nature is too imperfectly developed to enable
them to avail themselves of it. Formerly, psychology
was widely separated from physiology, and the study of
the mind began and ended with demonstrations of the
immense gulf by which it was separated from the body.
To-day, psychology has become a section of physiology,
and mental philosophers busy themselves with searching
out in all its details, the close dependence of the mind
upon the body. Insanity has become an inflammation of
the cortical substance of the brain: idiocy results from a
f&#339;tal meningitis: genius is a form of scrofula closely
allied to mania: in sleep, the brain loses blood, in intellectual
excitement, attracts blood; in the illumination
of the death-bed, or the delirium of drunkenness, the
circulation through the brain is quickened; in torpidity,
melancholy, stupidity, the circulation slackens and stagnates.</p>

<p>With this tendency, whose legitimacy we are certainly
far from disputing, it is inevitable that the old doctrine of
the mental inferiority of women should be defended, if at
all, on a new basis; a basis organic; structural, physiological,
hence incontrovertible; on an analysis, not of her
reasoning faculties, her impulses, her emotions, her logic,
her ignorance, but of her digestion, her nerves, her
muscles, her circulation. It is inevitable, therefore, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the two great functions of parturition and ovulation, of
which the latter is peculiar in form,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and the former
altogether peculiar to the female sex, should assume peculiar
importance in all discussions about women&mdash;inevitable,
that to these should be attributed the inferiority of
mental calibre or of mental achievement that few care
more openly to maintain.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>A mysterious interest has indeed always attached to
these functions. From the Mosaic law to Raciborski,
from the denunciations of the school-men to the rhapsodies
of Michelet, they have been invoked in every
theory on the nature of women; that is, in every theory
on the organization of society. In virtue of them, the
woman has been considered, now unclean, now angelic,
now touchingly (but irredeemably) helpless. In this connection,
the association of ideas has been almost always
too powerful and too varied to admit of a dispassionate
examination of facts. Yet to-day, as already said,
the old conclusions may be urged with even greater
force than before, because apparently based exclusively
upon such cool and impartial investigation.</p>

<p>The issue is certainly serious. From all sides surges testimony
to the importance of physical conditions as the
basis of mental and social life. According to many, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
by the absence of a few grains of iodine from the water of
drinking fountains, that the people of the Alps are turned
into <i>cretins</i>. According to others, it is by the presence of
a few grains of ergot in the bread, that the people of Tuscany
lose their limbs in gangrene. Endemics of abortion
depend on the impalpable vapors that arise from the
quicksilver mines of Spain. So delicately poised are the
forces of life, that an apparent trifle suffices to entirely
turn the scale. It is therefore not <i>a priori</i> improbable,
that the marked peculiarities of physical organization that
distinguish the female sex, should determine a radically
different mode of mental existence, and exact radically
different conditions of mental activity.</p>

<p>The whole question, however, is not one of probability
or of possibility, but of fact. Hence, the last persons capable
of judging in the matter, are those who have been
vividly impressed with those circumstances that furnish,
or may be made to furnish, food for the imagination.
Of these, Michelet is perhaps the type, but certainly
many of the reviewers who have been occupied with Dr.
Clarke's book, must be ranked in the same class. Would
it be disrespectful to Dr. Clarke's far better informed
judgment and technical knowledge to suggest, that he
himself does not seem to be perfectly free from the
influence of the glamour that invests the study of physiological
peculiarities in women, wherever these can be
made to tell upon any social or moral relations? Dr.
Clarke does not indeed affirm, with Michelet, that
women are essentially diseased. &ldquo;<i>La femme est une
malade</i>.&rdquo; Where Michelet leaves to the healthiest
women but a single week of every month for normal
existence, Dr. Clarke believes that one week out of the
month alone requires any special precautions, and that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
with decent care at this time, &ldquo;an immense amount of
work&rdquo; can be accomplished in the remainder. He is
careful to say, and even to repeat, that the intellectual
labor to which such disastrous results are attributed, is
not in itself incompatible with the nature of the woman,
nor, even when improperly pursued, can it be considered
as the sole cause of the delicate health of American
girls. Dr. Clarke indeed guards his every assertion with
a care and precision that is worthy of imitation by those
who draw such large deductions from his book. When,
however, all illegitimate inferences have been set aside,
and we come to the propositions really and categorically
maintained, we find the following:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>1st. During the catamenial period, <i>i.e.</i>, during one
week out of every month, a woman should abandon intellectual
or physical labor, either because she is already
incapacitated for it, or because she will be so ultimately,
if she does not take the precautionary rest.</p>

<p>2d. A large number of American girls become affected
with amenorrhea<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> or menorrhagia<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> solely on account of
excessive mental exertion at such periodical epochs of incapacity.</p>

<p>3d. It is possible to educate girls properly, only by
regularly intermitting their studies at such times, and by
&ldquo;conceding to nature her moderate but inexorable demand
for rest during one week out of four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4th. Consequently, it is chimerical to attempt to educate
girls with boys, whose organization requires no such
periodical intermittence.</p>

<p>5th. If sufficient precaution be observed during the
first years of adolescence, and the establishment of men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>struation,
such excessive care will become unnecessary
when the constitution is fully formed, <i>i.e.</i>, after the age
of eighteen, nineteen, or twenty years.</p></div>

<p>In regard to these propositions we wish to try to show&mdash;that
the first contains a certain exaggeration of fact: that
in the second a certain sequence of phenomena has been
attributed to the wrong cause, and that much more important
causes can be demonstrated: that in the third, a
precaution needed for many has been unduly generalized
for all: finally, that the fifth proposition entirely annuls
the inference contained in the fourth.</p>

<p>We believe the exaggeration of fact to be twofold,
that is, first, in regard to the number of girls to whose
health the menstrual period makes any sensible interruption.
Second, in regard to the duration of such interruption,
among the majority even of those who are indeed
obliged to submit to it.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke himself admits that the susceptibility he
describes in a certain number of cases, is not universal,
but he claims that this is the rule, and the reverse the
exception. Such a claim can only be substantiated by
an appeal to relative statistics, which are well known to
reverse many conclusions drawn from general impressions
of facts. Statistics are reliable only when compiled on a
large scale; but in an inquiry of this nature, a few contributions
from various sources are not useless. Among
twenty persons, not considering themselves invalids, of
whose cases I have taken notes, in six only, had menstruation
ever been the cause of any suffering whatever. The
ages of the persons questioned ranged from eighteen to
thirty, but the inquiry referred to the entire menstrual
life. Several among these young ladies had attended
mixed schools, and had never been compelled to absent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
themselves for a single day. Several had been engaged
for three or four years in the study of medicine; some, for
a much longer period, had engaged in its practice.</p>

<p>Among the six exceptions, one had been healthy until
twenty-one, and then had suffered from ovaritis, so that, although
engaging in the work of a healthy woman, she
should really be classed apart. One was subject to epileptic
convulsions, and may therefore be fairly ruled out
for the same reason. The remaining three were in good,
even robust, general health. In two, pain was experienced
for two days, and a certain diminution of capacity for
mental exertion, which, however, had never been sufficient
to necessitate its interruption. One of these cases
was a woman of thirty, who had been married for ten
years without child-bearing. In the third case on the
list, pain had never lasted more than six or twelve hours,
and had been very greatly diminished during four years
that the young lady had engaged in constant medical
study. Finally, in the fourth case, the early years of
adolescence were marked by quite severe dysmenorrhea,
the pain only lasting, however, twelve hours. Between
twenty-five and thirty, the pain disappeared, but the
menstruation became menorrhagic (excessive). This was
the only case on the list where no constant intellectual
exertion had ever been made, but where the nervous system
had been subjected to the strain of much moral
emotion and anxiety. The girl belonged, moreover, to a
family in which uterine disease was almost universal
among the female members.</p>

<p>While at first glance, therefore, it would appear that
the proportion of women invalidated by menstruation
was nearly as high as one-third, closer inspection shows
that among these cases selected at random, the proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
is only one-fifth or one-sixth, if the calculation be confined
to persons who had received much intellectual
training.</p>

<p>Among these cases, moreover, there is not one in which
the period of suffering is as long as would be indicated
by Dr. Clarke. Six, twelve, forty-eight hours is the outside
limit. If extended beyond this, or even if very
severe during this time, there is always reason to suspect
actual disease of the uterus or ovaries, and the cases
must be excluded from considerations only applicable to
persons in average health. From this point of view, the
week of rest demanded by Dr. Clarke, is as excessive
as the three weeks' disturbance so imaginatively described
by Michelet.</p>

<p>But it is true that the stand-point in Dr. Clarke's book
is somewhat different from this. He scarcely alludes to
the presence of pain in menstruation, because this is presumed,
when existing, to itself constitute a sufficient
warning against over mental exertion, indeed, to render
such exertion impossible. But the warning in question
is directed against a more insidious accident, that may
occur without pain, and which is more easily and imprudently
defied. This imminent danger is h&aelig;morrhage,
or an increase of the physiological flow to such an
extent that the vitality of the patient is drained as from
an open vein. The constant repetition of such h&aelig;morrhage
may lead to uterine congestions, or even to amenorrhea,
<i>i.e.</i>, entire absence of menstruation. But it
originates in functional disturbance, in exhaustion of
the nervous system by intellectual exertion. On account
of the imminence of this danger, the period of real incapacity
for mental effort lasts much longer than conscious
discomfort is likely to do&mdash;lasts, indeed, as long as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the physiological afflux of blood to the uterus&mdash;which,
by the means described, may at any moment become
excessive.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke alleges but one kind of proof of this assertion.
He relates a certain number of cases, interesting
in themselves, but whose histories are lacking in
many important details, where healthy girls, whose menstruation
was at first perfectly normal, became, after two
or three years' study at school, liable to monthly h&aelig;morrhages,
so excessive that their health was completely
undermined. No organic cause for such disorder could
be discovered. By interruption of study, rest, amusement,
travel, the h&aelig;morrhages were diminished, the
health restored. In several of these cases, however, resumption
of study on the old plan was followed by the
immediate return of all the previous accidents, and often
the constitution was entirely ruined.</p>

<p>We think that this argument might be exactly paralleled
by the following, which should prove whisky
drinking to be an efficient<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> cause of yellow fever. A
physician might select twenty cases of men, personally
known to him, who had lived twenty and thirty years in
New York or Boston, and never had yellow fever.
During this time they had taken little or no whisky,
but afterwards, removing to New Orleans, they fell into
the habit of drinking, and, at varying intervals from
that date, caught the fever, and in many instances, died.
Therefore, fever was due, at least in these cases, to the
newly contracted habit of drinking whisky.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Hamerton, in his little book on the intellectual life,
accuses women, even the bright and intelligent among
them, of a &ldquo;plentiful lack&rdquo; of intellectual curiosity. If
their attention is attracted to a phenomenon, they rarely
inquire as to its cause. If an assertion is made, they
accept it with enthusiasm or repel it with indignation,
but rarely analyze the conditions upon which the assertion
is based. This remark seems justified, though
perhaps not exclusively among women, by the total
absence of curiosity that has been shown in regard to
the physiological facts in question. The assertion that
nervous excitement, produced by intellectual work, is
capable of affecting an apparatus apparently so remote
from the organ of the intelligence as is the vascular
system of the uterus, certainly implies some most interesting
physiological facts and a mechanism the reverse
of simple. Into these facts and this mechanism
it behooves all to inquire, who assume the responsibility
of either accepting or rejecting Dr. Clarke's
theory and the deductions that have been made from
it.</p>

<p>This theory concerns exclusively one class of uterine
h&aelig;morrhages, those, namely, which may be traced to the
influence of the nervous system. Before analyzing such
influence it is important to notice two other causes of
menorrhagia, that are very frequently present in just
such cases as Dr. Clarke describes. These are prolonged
sedentary position, and deficiency of physical exercise.
Either may determine anemia, or impoverishment of the
blood, a condition which alone is sufficient to induce excessive
menstrual flow.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But, in addition, each has a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
special action more direct. By long continuance of a
sedentary position the equilibrium of the circulation is
disturbed, the blood is driven from the limbs to the
internal organs and the dependent portions of the trunk,
hence to the pelvis; but almost equally to the head, that
is hanging down over the school-desk. Hence, the
uterine h&aelig;morrhages, that are necessarily confined to
girls, are paralleled by the nose-bleeding, common to
girls and boys, and very frequent in such circumstances.
The cramped position of the chest interferes with respiration;
the bowels are generally constipated, and both
conditions again favor congestions of the visceral organs,
including the uterus, but not confined to it. To deficiency
of physical exercise is due, besides the disturbance
in the equilibrium of the circulation, first, a loss of heat
that should be evolved during the chemical processes of
muscular action; second, a loss of stimulus to the spinal
cord, which has, therefore, less power to control ganglionic
action. This latter, therefore, becomes irregular,
and the consequences of this irregularity will be
presently described. The influence of these two conditions&mdash;cramped
sedentary position, and deficiency of
muscular exercise&mdash;either sufficient to induce uterine
h&aelig;morrhage, must, therefore, be eliminated, before such
accident can be attributed to any other cause less simple
and direct. The first criticism to be addressed to the
&ldquo;statistics&rdquo; contained in Dr. Clarke's clinical chapter,
is, that this necessary elimination has not been made,
and one possible cause arbitrarily selected out of an
entire group of known causes.</p>

<p>As far as may be gathered from his book, Dr. Clarke's
theory may be thus formulated. Two intense nervous
actions cannot, without detriment, be sustained at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
same time by the same organization. The mental labor
demanded by school studies on the one hand, and the
physiological process of menstruation on the other, are
each connected with intense action of different parts of
the nervous system. They are, therefore, incompatible
with each other; and from the attempt to sustain them
simultaneously, results, first, the imperfect accomplishment
of each; second, the general exhaustion of the over-burdened
nervous system. To this exhaustion is to be
attributed the uterine h&aelig;morrhages upon which Dr.
Clarke insists as the accident particularly liable to be induced
by any continuous, <i>i.e.</i>, non-intermitting, system
of education.</p>

<p>For non-medical readers it is important to develop
the ellipsis and explain the facts upon which, if anywhere,
this theory is based.</p>

<p>The nervous system, though in many respects a unit,
consists of two great sections, called respectively, the
ganglionic system, and the cerebro-spinal; the latter
formed by the brain, the spinal cord, and the medulla-oblongata,
that connects them; the former, constituted
by smaller masses of nervous matter distributed in three
ways: First, in a double chain lying on each side of the
spinal cord, from the upper part of the neck to the pelvic
cavity that terminates the trunk. These masses are
called especially the sympathetic ganglia. Second, in so-called
plexuses, occupying different positions in the
cavity of the trunk, and standing in especial relation to
various organs; the solar or c&#339;liac plexus to the stomach,
liver, and spleen; the two renal plexuses to the kidneys;
the mesenteric plexuses to the intestine; finally, on
each side of the pelvis, the hypogastric plexus to the
bladder, uterus, and ovaries&mdash;the so-called genito-urinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
organs. Third, besides these principal ganglia exist others,
much more minute, imbedded in the muscular walls of
certain organs&mdash;as the heart (intro-cardiac ganglia), the
intestine (intestinal ganglia).</p>

<p>Each of these nervous masses contains nerve-cells as
well as nerve-fibres, and is capable of generating nerve-force.
Each, therefore, acts like a minute brain; and,
in fact, the entire ganglionic system of nerves is analogous
to the nervous system of certain among the lower
animals&mdash;the crustacea and mollusks. These possess
neither brain nor spinal cord; their nerve-centres, instead
of being concentrated in a cranium and vertebral
canal, are entirely disseminated through the cavities of the
trunk, as are the visceral plexuses in vertebrated animals.
In these, however, the addition of a brain and spinal
cord to the original rudimentary nervous system, powerfully
modifies and controls the action of the latter. The
degree of control is variable, according to the relative
predominance of the one or the other; and this predominance
varies, not only according to different species of
vertebrated animals, but also according to different individuals,
in that which presents the most conspicuous
capacity for individual variation&mdash;the human species.
Up to a certain point, increased development of the
cerebro-spinal system, attended by an increased development
of the osseo-muscular framework of the body, is
also accompanied by greater elaboration of the ganglionic
nerves supplying the viscera, upon whose efficient action
the nutrition of this frame depends. But beyond a certain
point in the ascending scale, the exactness of this
correlation ceases. The muscles and bones are smaller;
yet the structure of the cerebro-spinal organs, especially
the brain, becomes more elaborate; and hence the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>trol
exercised over the functions of the ganglionic system
is more complete, although the relative size of the
two systems is not much changed.</p>

<p>Such control or predominance is manifested in the following
ways: First. The functions of animal life, presided
over by the cerebro-spinal system, become proportionately
more important than those of vegetative or nutritive
life, carried on by the ganglionic. That is to say, the
acts of locomotion sustained by the spinal cord and the
nervo-muscular apparatus, and the intellectual acts of
the thought and will, sustained by the brain&mdash;are relatively
more prominent than are the acts of digestion,
respiration, circulation, etc., dependent on the functions
of the ganglionic nerves. Second. These latter functions
are themselves effected with more regularity and
more force, when the activity of the cerebro-spinal system
predominates over that of the ganglionic. Within
certain limits, this is so true, that human beings possess
over lower animals a superiority, not only of intellect,
but of capacity for digesting various articles of food;
and of maintaining their temperature in more various
states of the external atmosphere. Third. Finally, the
actions of the cerebro-spinal system, intellectual and
muscular, are more regular and powerful when not
liable to interruption from the operations of the ganglionic
nerves, and the visceral functions presided
over by them. When the boa-constrictor digests, he
falls into a state of torpor that exceeds in degree, but
not in kind, the drowsy rumination of a cow chewing
her cud. Such animals are slaves to their nutritive functions,
by which those of the brain and spinal cord may
at any time be, as it were, oppressed and overwhelmed.
The capacity for independence increases with every rise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
in the hierarchical scale of vertebrates, until it culminates
in man&mdash;able to think and talk over his dinner; to manufacture
heat in his limbs while drawing blood to his
cerebral hemispheres; to sustain in complete unconsciousness
innumerable delicate and complicated chemical
metamorphoses in all the tissues of his body,
while concentrating every conscious effort of his
mind upon equally delicate processes of thought and
will.</p>

<p>The peculiarities that, when coarsely emphasized,
serve to distinguish different species of animals from
one another, are repeated in more subtle gradations, as
varieties among the different classes, and even different
individuals of the human race. Here may be found,
at least, faint echoes and distant reminiscences of facts
that stand out in bold relief throughout the animal
kingdom. The classification of sex is certainly one of
those that offer an interesting opportunity for such comparison,
especially in regard to the relations existing
between the operations of the ganglionic, and those of
the cerebro-spinal system. As the authors who have
asserted the complete subordination of the brain to the
instincts in woman, have thus, perhaps unconsciously,
reduced her to the anatomical level of the crustacea;
so those who, like Dr. Clarke, insist on the incompatibility
between cerebral action and the process of ovulation,
imply a predominance of ganglionic activity in
women that must render them the physiological inferiors
of the animals or individuals in whom no such incompatibility
exists.</p>

<p>Were such opposition between cerebral and ganglionic
functions only noted when a rhythmical intermittence was
introduced into the latter, and were such rhythm observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
only in the phenomena of menstruation, it might indeed
be possible to fix upon women a peculiar mark of physiological
inferiority, almost sufficient to amount to a
stigma. But rhythmical movement is characteristic of
all physiological actions&mdash;of the beating of the heart,
the secretions of the stomach, the congestion of the
spleen, the circulation of the brain, quite as decidedly as
of the ripening of cells in the ovary. The tidal waves
described by Michelet have become the exclusive theme
of his eloquence, mainly because his attention was not
attracted to any but those connected with the more obvious
phenomena of menstruation. But many tidal
waves rise and cross each other in shorter or longer
cycles&mdash;waves of pulse and of temperature, of sleep
and wakefulness, intermittences of secretion and excretion.
In regard to the latter, it is noticeable that an
intermittent excretion, as of bile or urine, is provided
for by a continuous secretion, and that the same is true
of the excretion upon whose rhythm an erroneously exceptional
emphasis has been laid&mdash;that of the menstrual
fluid. Here, as elsewhere, the intermittent phenomenon
is preceded by long-continued cell growth&mdash;effected by
precisely such processes of cellular assimilation and metamorphosis
as take place in the elements of the liver and the
kidneys. The cell growth in question is effected in the ovaries;
the final stage of the process, the rupture of the containing
cell or ovisac, and escape of the ovule, is attended
by a concentration of nervous activity in the ganglionic
masses sending nerves to those organs&mdash;analogous to
that which occurs in the solar plexus at periods of digestion;
the fall of the ovule is itself analogous to the
shedding of epithelial cells in the gastric follicles; the
afflux of blood to the utero-ovarian veins, analogous to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the periodical congestion of the gastro-splenic vascular
apparatus. Only, in this last case, the congestion results
in the elaboration of a fluid secretion, the gastric juice;
in the utero-ovarian plexus, where no secretion is required,
the blood itself is discharged. It is difficult, with these
facts, to understand the assertion that. &ldquo;Periodicity is
the grand (<i>i.e.</i> exclusive) characteristic of the female sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In normal conditions, the process of digestion and of
menstruation are both accomplished without invading
the consciousness of the individual whose body is the
theatre of such extraordinary phenomena. Various
abnormal conditions raise the one or the other to the
sphere of consciousness&mdash;various stages in their evolution.
Consciousness of nutritive functions is always painful,
and digestion, quite as well as ovulation, may become a
process most disturbing to cerebral tranquility and
efficiency. The longer duration of the latter is compensated
by the more frequent occurrence of the former.
The ovaries are decidedly active during at least fifteen
days of every month; the stomach, during three or four
hours after each meal, or from nine to twelve hours a
day. As a matter of fact the digestive function is much
more often the occasion of conscious discomfort, than is
the function of ovulation. Whenever it becomes so,
the dyspeptic approaches the condition of the reptiles or
ruminating animals, in whom the process of digestion
so absorbs the powers of the nervous system that all
other modes of its activity are suspended. But such a
condition is universally regarded as an evidence of disease,
nor could any considerations concerning the complexity
and importance of the ganglionic nerves of the
stomach, or the intermittent character of digestion, convert
the misfortune of the dyspeptic into a physiologi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>cal
type for the race. At the most may it be admitted:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>1st. That in civilized communities dyspepsia is a very
common disease.</p>

<p>2d. That dyspeptics require rest of mind and body to
facilitate the laborious process of digestion.</p></div>

<p><i>C&aelig;teris paribus</i>, these same propositions may be held
of those suffering from abnormal modes of activity in
another part of the ganglionic system&mdash;that connected
with menstruation. A third proposition is, moreover,
common to both, namely, that repose of the cerebro-spinal
system is not required throughout the entire
period of ganglionic activity, unless in exceptionally
morbid cases. Thus, the process of digestion occupies
from three to five hours, but an hour's repose after dinner
is generally sufficient to avert discomfort. Similarly,
the process of ovulation continues over fifteen days&mdash;menstruation
lasts from three to six&mdash;but even in the
cases that demand rest, six to twelve hours is usually
enough, and more than enough.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that a slighter disturbance of normal
conditions is needed to render digestion painful than to
cause painful ovulation, that is, pain preceding the menstrual
flow. Pain in menstruation, which is much more
frequent, is dependent upon other conditions than the
activity of the ovaries, and lasts a very much shorter
time than does either the function of ovulation, or even
than the uterine congestion secondary to it. Outside
of actual uterine disease, the pain at this moment is most
often dependent on uterine cramp, itself excited by a
spasmodic contraction of blood-vessels that interfere with
its circulation. As these remarks are addressed to non-medical
readers, a word of explanation is here necessary.</p>

<p>It has been shown by experiment that the sudden ar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>rest
of the circulation in muscular fibre is sufficient to
induce in the latter violent contractions. Thus, the
cramps of the legs in cholera patients are due to the
stagnation of blood in their muscles. These cramps are
even more easily induced in the muscular fibre of the
viscera&mdash;the unstriped, involuntary muscles&mdash;such as exist
in the intestine, bladder, and uterus. Anything that
will cause a sudden contraction of the blood-vessels in
the uterus will, therefore, by cutting off the supply of
blood, cause the muscular fibre of the uterus to contract
in painful cramps. The small blood-vessels are themselves
provided with circular muscular fibres, whose contraction
necessarily draws the walls of the vessels
together, obliterates their canal, and shuts out the blood.
This contraction is effected by stimulation of the fine
nerves, called vaso-motor, that are distributed to these
muscular fibres, and which are derived from the sympathetic
ganglia, that form part of that same ganglionic
system from which the nerves of the ovaries and other
viscera are supplied. The utero-ovarian blood-vessels
derive their nerves from the hypogastric plexus, which,
formed by branches from both sympathetic ganglia and
spinal cord, is the exclusive source of the innervation of
the uterus and ovaries. The ganglionic nervous excitement
coincident with the maturation of the ovule and
the congestion of the uterus, is easily communicated to
the vaso-motor nerves of the latter organ. At the very
moment, therefore, that the uterine blood-vessels are dilated,
and blood is being exhaled into the uterine cavity,
an excessive stimulation of the vaso-motor nerves may
cause the blood-vessels to contract; the flow is then temporarily
arrested, the circulation in the uterus disturbed,
and its muscular fibres thrown into cramps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Or the opposite event may occur. As the stimulation
of the vaso-motor nerves causes contraction of the blood-vessels,
so their exhaustion or paralysis causes relaxation
of these same vessels, consequently, over-distension
with blood; and, if the door to h&aelig;morrhage be once
opened by the existence of the menstrual nisus, an excessive
flow of blood.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Such vaso-motor paralysis may
depend on one of three circumstances:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>1st. The original stimulus may be excessive, and
hence necessarily followed by reaction.</p>

<p>2nd. Schiff has shown that galvanization of a cerebro-spinal
nerve causes a dilatation of the blood-vessels in
the vicinity, as if the vaso-motor force were overpowered
by the excessive stimulation of the controlling
nerves. If excessive action of the brain or spinal cord
be analogous in its effects to galvanism of a spinal nerve,
it might be supposed to cause vaso-motor paralysis and
h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>3d. In general exhaustion of the nervous system,
both of its ganglionic and cerebro-spinal apparatus, the
vaso-motor nerves suffer with the rest, and the blood-vessels
lose their tone in consequence. It is to such
exhaustion that Dr. Clarke especially attributes excessive
uterine h&aelig;morrhage in young girls, and, as already said,
he refers the exhaustion to a single cause, namely, to
the attempt to impose on the nervous system two actions
of equal intensity, contrary to the fundamental law that
an intense evolution of nerve-force in one part of the
organism necessitates repose in the remainder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Independently of the three conditions where excessive
menstruation is connected with vaso-motor paralysis, a
fourth may be found directly in the excitement of the
ovarian plexus of nerves. This evolution of nerve-force
which accompanies the maturation of the ovule, is the
immediate cause of the afflux of blood to the utero-ovarian
vessels. The effect upon the latter is probably due
to the spinal nerve-fibres contained in the plexus, and
upon which the ganglionic excitement acts like the galvanism
in Schiff's experiment, already described. Direct
stimulation of the vaso-motor nerves, alone, as has been
said, contracts the blood-vessels. Stimulation of the spinal
fibres associated with them exercises the contrary
effect. An excessive stimulation of those fibres which
enter into the ganglionic masses, would have an effect
similar to that of excessive stimulation directly addressed
to the cerebro-spinal system, and the blood-vessels would
be not only dilated, but paralyzed.</p>

<p>Among the conditions, therefore, which may, by inducing
either pain or excessive h&aelig;morrhage, render
menstruation an abnormal process, and incompatible
with active exertion, three are directly connected with
the ganglionic system of nerves, the fourth indirectly,
by the possible influence upon them of the cerebro-spinal.
The first are excessive activity of the ovarian nerves,
derived from the hypogastric plexus; paralysis of uterine
vaso-motor nerves, as a secondary result of this excessive
action: exhaustion of these same vaso-motor nerves, as
an element of general nervous exhaustion. The last
theoretical condition would be, excitement of the brain
or spinal cord, in a manner analogous to what may be
determined by a galvanic current, and followed, therefore,
by the same consequence&mdash;paralysis of vaso-motor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
nerves, and excessive dilatation of the blood-vessels.</p>

<p>The two first conditions among these four are most
easily induced when the activity of the ganglionic system
is habitually predominant in the organism, or when
this activity is habitually irregular. This irregularity,
marked by vaso-motor spasm, uterine cramp, and pain,
represents the lowest degree of disorder, which, if long
continued, passes to the next&mdash;of vaso-motor paralysis,
accompanied by excessive h&aelig;morrhage; and finally may,
as Dr. Clarke has pointed out, be followed by paralysis
in the ovarian plexus itself, with consequent cessation
of ovulation, and amenorrhea, or absence of menstruation.</p>

<p>This habitual predominance or irregularity of the
ganglionic nerves implies, as has been seen, a relatively
deficient innervation or generation of nerve-force in the
cerebro-spinal system. It could not, therefore, be
ascribed to excessive activity of that system, except in
the cases where this has been pushed to the point of
complete exhaustion. It is, in fact, a matter of common
observation, that hysterical and anemic women, in whom
disordered menstruation is most frequently observed,
are conspicuously destitute of habits implying either
cerebral or spinal activity&mdash;that is, they neither think
much, nor take much physical exercise.</p>

<p>The last two cases, however, of cerebro-spinal excitement
or exhaustion, may be supposed to imply a predominant
activity of the cerebro-spinal system.</p>

<p>Inquiry into the effects of cerebro-spinal excitement
is rendered extremely complicated on account of the
following facts:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>1st. Experimental excitation, by means of galvanism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
or mechanical irritation, causes different results when
applied to spinal nerves, to different parts of the spinal
cord, or to different parts of the brain. Galvanism applied
to a spinal nerve, determines, it has been said,
dilatation of blood-vessels, and increased secretion in
glands. But galvanism applied to the spinal cord in the
neck, causes contraction of blood-vessels. Mechanical
irritation of other parts of the spinal cord, on the other
hand, causes vaso-motor paralysis and dilatation of
blood-vessels. This is especially true of that part lying
in the loins, and which contains a peculiar nervous centre,
that stands in special relation to the uterus and
ovaries, and is involved in many of their diseases, either
as a cause or effect. Systematic galvanic irritation of
the brain has been little attempted, until in some very
recent experiments; but its effects are already known
to be most various, according to the part to which it is
applied. The brain is not a single organ, but rather a
collection of organs, differing from one another in
function even more than in situation, and among them
only some are really concerned in the production of
thought.</p>

<p>2d. In the medulla oblongata exists a nervous centre
called the vaso-motor centre, because of its close relations
with the vaso-motor nerves. Stimulation of this centre
causes contraction of the blood-vessels. Severing the
same part causes paralysis of the vaso-motor nerves and
dilatation of the blood-vessels. The conditions of the
brain that have been most clearly shown to influence
the circulation, are those that can be proved to take an
effect on this vaso-motor centre. If, as is probable, different
forms of cerebral action induce or depend on different
cerebral conditions, or involve different sections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of the cranial masses, this effect would necessarily be
different, and the influence on the circulation vary
accordingly.</p>

<p>3d. No experimental proof has hitherto been obtained
that stimulation of the cerebral organs lying above the
vaso-motor centre, and which include those possessing
the function of thought, ever paralyzes this centre;
but, as it is only by such paralysis that cerebral conditions
can induce dilatation of blood-vessels, it must
follow that no <i>experimental proof</i> at present exists that
stimulation of the brain ever does cause such dilatation&mdash;that
is, ever does become a cause of h&aelig;morrhage. The
<i>clinical</i> facts for such a supposition are those in which
the occurrence of an emotion is followed by flushing of
the face, acceleration of the pulse, hot or cold perspirations,
phenomena all indicative of dilatation of the
blood-vessels, with temporary paralysis of their nerves
and of their vaso-motor centre. It is not proved, however,
that the emotions capable of causing these effects
really result from a stimulation of the brain. On the
contrary, they are generally accompanied by diminished
activity of that cerebral function that most certainly
does depend on such stimulation&mdash;the function, namely,
of thought.</p></div>

<p>Now, since the power of thought and the power of
the vaso-motor centre are equally paralyzed under these
circumstances, it is more probable that the phenomena
which most nearly resemble those of stimulation of the
brain are either confined to some special part of it,
whose activity is in antagonism to the rest, or else are
really phenomena of exhaustion, and therefore come
under another category. But if these do not, no facts
exist to prove that stimulation of the intellectual func<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>tions
of the brain is in itself capable of producing vaso-motor
paralysis&mdash;that is, of becoming a cause of h&aelig;morrhage;
or, in other words, stimulation of the brain cannot
be likened in its effect to galvanic stimulation of a
spinal nerve. But if stimulation of the brain does not
paralyze, it must increase the tonicity of the vaso-motor
centre, and hence the force and regularity of the circulation.
Up to a certain point, these characters do indeed
increase, with increase of pressure in the cerebral blood-vessels.
They increase also during intellectual operations,
unattended by emotion, in which a similar increase
of pressure must take place, on account of the afflux of
blood to the cerebral hemispheres, when these are
aroused to activity.</p>

<p>These facts already indicate a radical difference between
the nature of the cerebral actions involved in
emotion and in thought. From them also we should
infer in all cases where vaso-motor paralysis was
apparently traceable to excess of cerebral activity, either
<i>that exhaustion had already occurred, or that the
activity was not intellectual but emotional</i>. In the
first case, we should be immediately brought to our
fourth possible condition for uterine h&aelig;morrhage,
dependent on modifications of the cerebro-spinal
system. It is admitted, as the result of many experiments
and pathological observations that need not here
be quoted, that exhaustion of certain parts of the brain
and spinal cord may induce vaso-motor paralysis, and
that, if a cause for h&aelig;morrhage is already in operation,
a passive flow of blood may be indefinitely increased.
Such a course is the menstrual crisis, without which
even the vaso-motor paralysis is usually unable to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
determine uterine h&aelig;morrhage.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In connection with
it, physical exercise, pushed to the point of exhausting
the spinal cord, and the peculiar centre in its lumbar
portion, or mental effort so excessive and prolonged as
to exhaust the brain, and the general vaso-motor centre,
might become causes of menorrhagia.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that if such exhaustion had
been produced previous to the menstrual epoch, the
effect would be precisely the same as if the morbific
causes operated only at the time of menstruation. From
this point of view the precaution suggested by Dr.
Clarke, of intermitting intellectual effort during the
menstrual period, would be inadequate whenever it was
not superfluous. But in Dr. Clarke's theory this period
has a peculiar influence in rendering morbific conditions
that at other times are innocuous. This, in virtue
of the law already quoted, that the evolution of force at
one centre of the nervous system is incompatible with
an evolution of equal intensity at another, since it
diminishes the sum of resources distributed to the
nervous system as a whole. Hence, relatively to the
amount of power left in the brain, the same exertion
becomes very much more fatiguing, and may easily lead
to exhaustion with all its consequences.</p>

<p>Nothing seems more simple than this proposition when
thus stated. But all physiological problems are complicated
by the element of quantity&mdash;circumstance which
almost indefinitely limits our power of making absolute
assertions. The comparison already made between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
process of digestion and that of menstruation should
suffice to show that there is no absolute incompatibility
between the evolution of nerve force at the ganglionic
centres and at the cerebro-spinal. For if so the process
of digestion would necessitate such absolute torpor of
the brain and spinal cord as certainly would be quite incompatible
with the exigencies of civilized life. There
is a certain alternation between the periods of activity
of the two systems, but this varies in infinite gradation;
from the digestive torpor of the savage, analogous to
that of ruminating animals, up to the unconscious
digestion of healthy men of temperate habits and
marked intellectual and physical activity, to whom all
hours of the day are nearly equally suitable for exertion.
As previously said, up to a certain point, the incompatibility
diminishes with every increase in the development
of the cerebral system.</p>

<p>But again, the evolution of nerve force required by
ovulation should not normally be comparable in intensity
with that effected in cerebral or spinal action.
Whenever it is so the activity of the ganglionic system
must be in excess, or that of the cerebro-spinal system
must be deficient. It is true that among the women
of highly civilized societies, one or both of these conditions
very frequently exist, but it is then as truly abnormal
as is the dyspepsia and spleen&mdash;equally prevalent.</p>

<p>Although, for certain purposes, it is necessary to consider
the ganglionic and cerebro-spinal system together,
as parts of a single apparatus, it is important also to
remember the boundaries that lie between them. It is
much easier, by intense muscular exertion, that necessitates
evolution of force in the spinal cord, to render the
brain incapable of function, than to do so by intense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
action of the ganglionic nerves, whose connection with
the brain, though real, is much less direct. Were it
not so, life would be much more precarious than it is,
and advance in civilization impossible; because the
necessarily incessant activity of the nerves involved in
nutritive processes would too largely impair the action
of the brain. The effect on the brain of a really irresistible
and predominant activity of the nerves involved
in the reproductive organs, is to be studied in the
lower animals, and in phenomena that, fortunately, are
rarely to be observed in healthy individuals of the
human race. Still less can such confessedly morbid
predominance be considered as a peculiar liability of the
female sex in this race. A singular tendency exists in
many quarters, and is strongly manifested in Dr. Clarke's
book, to assume that considerations pertaining to sex
and to the functions of reproduction exercise such an
enormous influence upon one sex, and none at all upon
the other. Since the discovery in 1827 of the ovule or
female reproductive cell, there can be no question of the
complete physiological equivalence and analogy between
the essential organs of reproduction in the two sexes.
The period of their development, the influence of such
development on the entire nutrition of the body, the
irregularities of nutritive or of cerebro-spinal action,
that may be caused by irregularities in such development,
are also completely analogous. It is only the
organ of gestation that is peculiar to the female&mdash;the
organ of maternity&mdash;the function that, although resulting
from sex, transcends sex and belongs to the race. In a
double sense is the uterus secondary to the ovaries.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
For its physiological action, both in menstruation and in
pregnancy, is the direct consequence of ovarian functions,
and closely dependent upon them; and the period
of its prominent activity does not come until after the
action of the ovaries has been completely established;
that is, the period of maternity is, or should be, consecutive
to the period of adolescence, and the work of
gestation only entered upon when the work of ovulation
has long been thoroughly accomplished.</p>

<p>The analogies have been much overstrained that exist
between the menstrual epoch of an adolescent girl and
the pregnancy of an adult woman. They are illustrations
of a general physiological law that in some cases
might be called a caprice of nature, in virtue of which
the rudiments of a process that is to be effected at a future
epoch are sketched out during an epoch already existing.
The afflux of blood to the uterus during the rupture
of the ovisac, cannot be shown to be useful by any
effort of teleological physiologists. It predicts, however,
the afflux that will be necessary at a future pregnancy, in
precisely the same way as the growth of the lungs in
the f&#339;tus predicts the future necessity for respiration, or
the formation of ovules in the ovaries of the newborn
girl, predicts the future necessity of a reproductive apparatus.
But to impose on the girl the precautions necessary
to the mother, is one way to enfeeble and prematurely
age her. In the same way is the child enfeebled by
premature considerations in regard to sex that do not yet
exist, and the adult woman so often treated as old as
soon as she has borne children, which should be a proof
not of age, but of maturity.</p>

<p>From the preceding considerations we may, we think,
conclude:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>1st. That unless the brain and spinal cord <i>had been
already exhausted or on the point of exhaustion previous
to the menstrual</i> crisis, this alone would be insufficient
to exhaust them.</p>

<p>2d. That the degree of exhaustion in the cerebro-spinal
system, necessary to determine vaso-motor paralysis,
is very great, and much transcends that likely to be induced
by the mental exertion required in the ordinary
curriculum of a girl's school.</p>

<p>3d. That therefore, when vaso-motor paralysis, as indicated
by uterine h&aelig;morrhage, has occurred apparently
in consequence of such mental exertion, it is really due
to some other conditions existing with this.</p></div>

<p>Of these we have already insisted upon two&mdash;sedentary
position and deficiency of physical exercise.</p>

<p>Authors have less frequently analyzed the effects of
another circumstance so often accompanying the intellectual
exertions of school life, namely, the morbid emotional
excitement that is incident either to the period of
adolescence or to the injudicious educational <i>r&eacute;gime</i>.
To precisely appreciate these effects, it will be necessary
to push a little further the analysis already commenced,
of the mode of activity exhibited by different portions of
the brain during the evolution of thought or of emotion.</p>

<p>Among all the obscurities that overhang this subject, a
few facts are, nevertheless, demonstrated. The first that
concerns us is the existence of the vaso-motor centre,
whose situation and functions have been already described.
The second is the localization of the function
of thought in the circumvolutions of gray matter on the
surface of the cerebral hemispheres&mdash;fact that we have
already assumed to be sufficiently demonstrated. The
third class of facts include those, also insisted upon, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
indicate a peculiar influence of the emotions upon the
circulation and the vaso-motor nerves. In some cases
these are stimulated, and the blood-vessels spasmodically
contract, the cheek pales, the hands and feet grow
cold, chills creep down the back&mdash;even nausea may occur
from interference with the circulation of the brain;
or else the cheek flushes, the temples throb, the heart
beats more rapidly, when, from temporary paralysis of
these same nerves, the blood-vessels are suddenly dilated.</p>

<p>These phenomena indicate that either the anatomical
seat or the mode of generation of emotion, is in closer
connection with the cerebral vaso-motor centre than is
the seat of ideas.</p>

<p>From this positive stand-point we may be permitted to
cautiously venture a little further, in the direction of a
theory for the precise localization of the organs of emotion.</p>

<p>It is well known that at the base of the brain are collected
certain masses of nervous matter, that constitute
nervous centres or cerebral ganglia, that are in very intimate
connection, on the one hand, with nerves of special
sense, as the optic<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and olfactory,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> on the other with
nerves of general sensation and motion.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> To this intricate
part of the brain, these centres, converge the
nerve-fibres collected in the spinal cord and medulla oblongata,
and from them radiate other fibres that pursue a
divergent course, and finally terminate in the gray matter
of the cerebral hemispheres. Thus, the brute impressions
brought from the periphery of the body, are
conveyed to special foci of concentration, thence to be
transmitted to the gray matter at the surface of the
brain, and become material for thought. Conversely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
impulses generated in the nerve-cells devoted to the elaboration
of thought, pass through these same intermediate
stations before they acquire sufficient consistency to
affect the motor-nerves, and, through them, the muscular
osseous apparatus of the body. Before a sensory impression
can become a thought, or a voluntary impulse
express itself by motion, each must be converged toward
these centres, whence it afterwards radiates, along divergent
fibres, directed now above, to the surface of the brain,
now below, on a longer course, to the surface of the body.</p>

<p>Luys has suggested, therefore, that these intermediate
stations of cerebral organs constitute peculiar centres in
which crude nervous impressions sustain a primary elaboration
before passing to the surface of the brain. Further,
that the generation of emotions, which differs in so
many respects from that of ideas, is especially connected
with these centres as distinguished from the cerebral
hemispheres lying above them. This idea is based on
the following facts:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>1st. The nervous masses in question are well developed
in animals in whom the cerebral hemispheres, or
organs of intellection, are comparatively rudimentary;
and in these same animals, while little or no capacity
for abstract reasoning exists, the instincts and feelings
attain individuality and intensity.</p>

<p>2d. The emotions stand in much closer relation to
sensation and movement, than do the operations of
thought. The latter, indeed, necessitate immobility,
and, if sufficiently intense, diminish the power of sensation;
they seem to indicate a concentration of nervous
action upon organs unconnected with motility or sensibility.
On the contrary, movements of some kind are
the first result of emotions, of which each is expressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
by a characteristic gesture, and these increase in violence
with the intensity of the feeling. A powerful emotion,
as well as an absorbing thought, may, it is true, annihilate
or transform sensation; but this is explicable by the
fact that the strongest emotions are excited by ideas.
Hence, on the hypothesis, the impression radiating downwards
to the emotional centres from the cerebral hemispheres,
would counteract a sensory impression radiating
upwards from them, by a literal interference analogous
to that observed in opposing waves of sound. But as
the direction of the impression generating emotion coincides
with that of the motor impulses, the latter would
not be counteracted, but reinforced.</p>

<p>3d. Conversely, sensations of various kinds, transmitted
to these centres from different parts of the body, are
as effective as ideas in generating or modifying emotional
conditions&mdash;often, indeed, much more so. The
hypochondria of the ancients, the dyspeptic melancholia
of the moderns, the infinite varieties of hysterical sensibility,
are all well-known illustrations of this undisputed
fact. The elastic consciousness of well-being that emboldens
the volition of certain individuals, as distinguished
from the timid apprehensiveness that constantly
depresses the powers of others, is connected, not with
any view of external conditions appreciable by the intellect,
but with a vast multitude of vague bodily sensations,
of which each alone fails to make a distinct
impression upon consciousness.</p>

<p>4th. An impression made on one part of the sympathetic
system is easily communicated to another, and to
the ganglionic masses of the visceral plexuses, already
described. Hence the rapid effect of many emotions
upon the processes of digestion; hence the epigastric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
response to the emotion of fear, which led Bichat to
localize this feeling in the solar plexus lying behind the
stomach. In a precisely similar manner may the effect
of emotion be distributed to the ganglionic nerves of the
kidneys, uterus, and ovaries, leading to the flow of urine
that terminates a paroxysm of hysteria, often suppressing
menstruation, by contraction of uterine blood vessels, or
causing an excess of menstrual h&aelig;morrhage, from an
excessive excitement of the ovarian nerves during the
menstrual crisis. None of these effects are observed
after a simple act of thinking, unattended by emotion.</p>

<p>5th. Probably on account of such an influence upon
the vaso-motor nerves, the blood vessels, and, consequently,
the processes of nutrition, the evolution of emotions
is attended with much greater fatigue than is that
of thought. The fatigue that may follow a prolonged
intellectual operation is, moreover, distinctly localized in
the head, and exists in various degrees, from simple inability
for further attention, to decided sensation of
weariness, or even pain. But the fatigue experienced
after excessive emotion, especially if this be of a depressing
character and accompanied by tears (which imply
vaso-motor paralysis in the lachrymal glands), is generalized
all over the body, and is, moreover, very much
more often followed by headache, or by symptoms of
cerebral congestion or anemia, than is the act of thinking,
except in persons morbidly predisposed. When
nervous exhaustion is observed after prolonged mental
effort, one of two other conditions, or both, has nearly
always co-existed, namely, deficiency of physical exercise,
or presence of active emotion, as, ardent ambitions
or harassing anxieties. In a few cases, the mental
effort itself, by the afflux of blood determined to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
brain, or the excessive activity imposed upon its elements,
becomes an efficient cause of disease. But in
these cases there is either an original imperfection in the
organization of the nerve tissues, or the mental effort has
been of that exceptionally intense nature of which none
but a few minds are capable. Finally, in these cases, the
resulting disease is seated in the brain or spinal column.</p></div>

<p>This latter remark is of great importance for our purpose;
for it tends to show that diseases produced elsewhere
within the range of the ganglionic system of
nerves&mdash;as the menstrual h&aelig;morrhage, that we are especially
considering&mdash;must be due to some other nervous
act than that of thought.</p>

<p>From the foregoing considerations, we believe, may be
again inferred, first, that the radical difference which
exists between the cerebral operations that result in
thought, and those that accompany the evolution of
emotion, probably depends upon the fact, that in the
former central nervous action remains more or less
localized on the surface of the cerebral hemispheres,
while, in the latter, the great ganglia lying at the base
of the brain, and hence nearer the vaso-motor centre, are
called into play; second, that the effects of such action
are more rapidly generalized throughout the nervous
system, and, by causing the dilatation of the blood-vessels
in the manner described, exhaust the central
nervous system in a twofold manner, by a disturbance
of its circulation, and by a direct depression of its
nutrition, when the modifications of the circulation
exaggerate the nutrition elsewhere. Repeated excitement
and consecutive paralysis of the vaso-motor nerves,
therefore, serve as the most efficient means of draining
off the force of the cerebro-spinal nervous system. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
it has been seen, that a depression of its power is followed
by an exaggerated and irregular activity of the
ganglionic system, to which are due most of the phenomena
observed in hysteria and in ordinarily nervous
women. These are in many respects different from
those observed in men suffering from so-called nervous
debility, for the reason, that in them the ganglionic system
of nerves is less prominent, and its irregularities of
action therefore less marked, when the control exercised
by the cerebro-spinal system has been diminished. If
the vaso-motor centre of the brain is only influenced
when the ganglia at the base are called into activity,
and if their activity coincides with emotion, and not
with thought, whose organ is much more remote, in the
cerebral hemispheres, it should follow that emotion, and
not thought, should most easily influence the vaso-motor
centre, and be followed by peculiar modifications of the
ganglionic system and of the circulation. This supposition
is confirmed by the occurrence of many vaso-motor
phenomena that commonly follow emotion, but are
rarely observed after even prolonged thought. It is not,
therefore, stimulation of the intellect, but excitement of
the feelings, that can be shown from physiological data
to have an injurious effect upon the vaso-motor nerves of
the uterus, or the ganglionic nerves of the ovaries, or, in
other words, can be concerned in the production of
uterine h&aelig;morrhage. To be just, however, it must be
admitted, that still another view is possible. For it might
be affirmed: first, that in women communication of impressions
between different parts of the nervous system
was so rapid, that the limitation of activity to a particular
part of the brain was impossible; in other words,
that the distinction between thought and emotion was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
effaced, because any action set up at the surface of the
cerebral hemispheres, invariably called the emotional
centres into play; or, second, it might be said, that the
original organization of the cerebral tissues in women
was so imperfect, that a slight amount of activity was
sufficient to exhaust them, and hence become a cause of
h&aelig;morrhage by the mechanism previously described.</p>

<p>Neither of these assertions is made by Dr. Clarke,
but it is certain that one or both of them might be made in
regard to a large number of women. To these, however,
severe intellectual exertion would be injurious, not
only if performed during the week of menstruation, but if
performed at all. Nervous excitement during the inter-menstrual
period, is quite as likely to be followed by pain
or excessive h&aelig;morrhage at the next menstruation, as if
it had been sustained at the critical epoch itself. Nature
generally provides for a portion of this contingency, by
rendering such women little capable of mental exertion,
and little ambitious for it. But, though they be kept in
the most complete intellectual quiescence, the condition
of these unfortunates is scarcely improved. Withdrawn
from the serene and powerful movement of intellectual
life, they are left to all the agitations of their ganglionic
nerves; impressions, unfelt by others, raise storms of
feeling in them, that actually ravage their nervous system;
efforts that but slightly fatigue stronger organizations,
are completely exhausting to theirs; health, indeed,
is only possible to them while they may be sheltered
from exposure, saved from exertion, and carefully screened
from excitement and shock.</p>

<p>The method, therefore, suggested by Dr. Clarke for
enabling young girls to master Latin and Greek without
sacrifice of their health, seems to us to be addressed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the wrong element in the group of supposed causes. In
the cases related by Dr. Clarke, there is nothing to show
that the menorrhagia was occasioned by study during
the week of menstruation, rather than during the three
weeks that preceded it. Nor that even then, the true
cause of disease was to be found in the intellectual exertion
of mastering the school text-books, rather than in the
moral excitement due to competition, haste, and cramming,
or the close confinement necessitated by prolonged school
hours, and unhealthy sedentary habits out of school.</p>

<p>The complexity of causation in such instances may
be well illustrated by the following case, that I select
on account of its great resemblance to the type described
by Dr. Clarke.</p>

<p>A young girl of sixteen consulted me on account of
menstrual h&aelig;morrhage so excessive as to induce complete
exhaustion, bordering upon syncope. She had
menstruated for two years&mdash;during the first, in quite a
normal manner&mdash;but during the second, had become
subject to these menorrhagic accidents, since residence
at boarding-school. It would have been easy to decide
that the disturbance was directly due to the severity of
the mental efforts exacted by the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of the school.
But on further inquiry it appeared: first, that the
mother of the girl had always been subject to menorrhagia,
and it is well known that this often occurs exclusively
as the result of hereditary predisposition. Second,
that just before the entrance to school, and the disturbance
of menstruation, the girl had been living in a malarial
district, and had suffered from malarial infection,
which is again a frequent cause of menorrhagia. Third,
that the studies pursued at school were unusually rudimentary
for a girl of sixteen, and indeed, below the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
natural capacity of her intelligence, had this been
properly trained. But the hours of study were so ill-arranged,
that the pupils were kept over their books, or
at the piano, nearly all day, and even in the intervals
allowed for recreation, no exercise was enforced. It was
therefore frequently neglected, and the girl, with hereditary
predisposition to menorrhagia, increased by malarial
infection, and also by certain rheumatic tendencies,
was allowed to expend upon elementary text-books an
amount of time, attention, and nervous energy, that
would have been deemed excessive for the most valuable
intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>All physicians are aware of the frequent dependence
of menorrhagia upon anemia, not only acquired,
but congenital. The existence of anemia, or of an
imperfect elaboration of the blood and vascular system,
previous to the occurrence of the first menstruation,
is a possible condition of menstrual disorder that must
always be very carefully eliminated before any other cause
be assigned. It is, moreover, extremely frequent. Others
exist, but are more rare&mdash;as peculiar congenital predisposition
to h&aelig;morrhages, with or without true hemophilia<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>With such causes (anemia, rheumatism, malarial infection,
hereditary predisposition), the observance of rest
during the menstrual week would be quite ineffectual so
long as the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of the other three weeks remain uselessly
unhygienic. If the menstrual crisis finds the uterine
blood-vessels already deprived of tonicity through nerv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>ous
exhaustion or other cause, h&aelig;morrhage is as likely to
occur as if that tonicity were only exhausted at the
epoch of menstruation. In the cases described by Dr.
Clarke, the cure was effected, when at all, not by an
intermittence of study, which does not seem to have
been tried, but by its complete cessation, together with
that of all the conditions by which it was accompanied.</p>

<p>Again, therefore, it may be said, that wherever such
intermittence is not superfluous, it would be inadequate
for the purpose for which it is designed.</p>

<p>But this conclusion may seem to be much more severe,
and, to those interested in the education of girls, much
more disagreeable than that formulated by Dr. Clarke.
We firmly believe, however, that truth never can be
disagreeable when it is really understood in all its bearings
and all its consequences, and conversely, that any
proposition framed with a view to supposed desirableness
rather than veracity, is almost certain to lead in the
end to consequences quite undesirable. We will not,
therefore, try to decide whether it may be more agreeable
to believe that the health of adolescent girls requires
general and permanent supervision, or that all responsibility
may be discharged by confining them to a sofa
and a novel for one week out of every four; to believe
that a certain number of women, as of men, are always
unfit for intellectual exertion, or that all women are
inevitably rendered so unfit during one quarter of their
lives at times unknown to outsiders, and which, therefore,
may be at any time; to believe that the increased delicacy
of women in civilized societies depends on a cultivated
predominance of their ganglionic nervous system
and emotional functions, or on the excessive stimulus of
the cerebro-spinal system and on intellectual cultivation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>More useful than such discussion is the consideration
of the methods that might be proposed, instead of that
suggested by Dr. Clarke in the third proposition we have
formulated from his book. Dr. Clarke's method is to
provide regular intermittences in the education of girls,
&ldquo;conceding to Nature her moderate but inexorable demand
for rest, during one week out of four.&rdquo; The
method that we believe to be suggested by the foregoing
considerations would be more complex, but, we think, at
once more effectual and less inconvenient. It may be
stated in the following formula: &ldquo;Secure the predominance
of the cerebro-spinal system over the activity of
the ganglionic.&rdquo; Since the activity of the cerebro-spinal
system may be roughly<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> divided into a twofold direction,
intellectual and muscular, this predominance is to be
secured by assiduous cultivation of the intellect as compared
with the emotions, and of the muscles of the
limbs as compared with the muscular fibre of the blood-vessels.
In other words, the evil effects of school competition,
and of the emotional excitement natural to
adolescence, are to be combated by a larger, wider,
slower, and more complete intellectual education than at
present falls to the lot of either boys or girls. And the
dangers incident to the development of new activity in
the ganglionic nervous system by the functions of the
ovaries, the dangers of irregular circulation, vaso-motor
spasm and paralysis, are to be averted by systematic
physical exercise, that shall stimulate the spinal nerves,
quicken the external circulation, and favor the development
of muscles at the moment that their activity
threatens to be overpowered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of systematic training on the spinal nervous
system, and on the bones and muscles dependent
upon it, has been often enough described. Far less
attention has been given to the equally positive development
that can be secured for the brain, under the influence
of prolonged and systematic exercise of its functions.
An immense increase of functional capacity is
possible, even without marked anatomical alteration;
but even this is observed under circumstances that seem
to indicate that it is rather the effect than the cause of
changes in function. Retzius (Muller's Archives, 1845,
p. 89<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>) observes that the female cranium varies in size
much more than the male: &ldquo;Female crania of the higher
and middle classes are in general much smaller relatively
than is the case among the peasants, a fact which probably
depends on the different mode of life and occupation.
The skull of the Norway female peasants is as large and
strong as that of the men.&rdquo; Welcker himself makes a
somewhat analogous observation in regard to the crania
of different races, the differences between the sexes being
more marked in proportion to the civilization of the
race&mdash;that is, to the degree of specialization of education,
and mental occupation. He gives the following table:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" summary="Cranial Capacity">
<tr><td align='left'>CRANIAL CAPACITY.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='center'>WOMAN.</td><td align='center'>MAN.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Asiatic Caucasian</td><td align='center'>1</td><td align='center'>1.27.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>European</td><td align='center'>1</td><td align='center'>1.17.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Mongols</td><td align='center'>1</td><td align='center'>1.13.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Malays</td><td align='center'>1</td><td align='center'>1.08.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Americans</td><td align='center'>1</td><td align='center'>1.08.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Negroes</td><td align='center'>1</td><td align='center'>1.07.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Besides the prominent fact upon which Welcker insists,
this table indicates two others. First, that the
anatomical difference in the higher races is too little to
explain the general difference in intellectual achievement
really observed between the two sexes of these
races. Second, that the difference is not in precise proportion
to the maximum intelligence attained by the
race, but to the social inferiority and subjection of the
women; for the Asiatics (Hindoos) stand highest on the
scale, the Europeans only second; and the excess of the
first over the second, in regard to the point in question,
is greater than the excess of the Europeans over the
other races named.</p>

<p>The general fact that, beyond certain well-defined limits,
the activity of the cerebro-spinal system and its relative
predominance over the ganglionic, is to be determined dynamically
rather than anatomically, is insisted upon by
Laycock (<i>Med. Times and Gaz.</i>, 1862). This writer
observes that the large, slowly-nourished brain of a lymphatic
man, frequently evolves much less intellectual force
than does the smaller, perhaps more compact, brain of
another, in whom the circulation is more active, and the
nutrition probably more elaborate.</p>

<p>These facts, and many others that might be quoted,
are pertinent to our subject, on account of the influence
exercised over the ganglionic centres by the development
and functional activity of those of thought. Stimulation
of the cerebral hemispheres is one of the most powerful
means of counteracting paralysis of the vaso-motor centre,
with all its consequences. Habitual activity of these centres&mdash;implying,
psychologically, habitual activity of thought,
physiologically, a more active local circulation&mdash;is therefore
the best method at our disposal for permanently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
counteracting tendencies to irregular action in this centre,
in the emotional ganglia lying in its vicinity, and in the
vaso-motor nerves dependent upon it.</p>

<p>A method of such general supervision does not in
itself forbid the co-education of girls and boys; for from
this more general point of view, the health of the latter
during adolescence really requires precisely the same
precautions as that of the former. Attention is less frequently
drawn to the precautions required in the case
of boys, mainly because such precautions are more frequently
observed in regard to them. But besides, girls
arrive at the period of adolescence already enervated by
the senseless training of their childhood, on which distinctions
of sex have been obtruded long before they are
established by nature. Finally, since peculiarities relating
to the sexual organs are inherited, if at all, from the
parent of the same sex,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the germs of uterine diseases
acquired by mothers too frequently exist in daughters,
ready to be developed at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, therefore, the existing generation
of girls, especially in New England, too often possess a
delicacy of organization greater than that of their brothers,
and demanding a special supervision and watchfulness,
best bestowed when they are educated apart.
For the reasons already detailed at length, we think that
such supervision does not necessitate periodical intermittence
of study, except in special cases, that constitute a
decided minority among the whole. It does necessitate,
however, the more difficult task of providing for adequate
rest and exercise during every day of the month.
It necessitates a more rational system of study, a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
profound training, a more intelligent view of the real
character of intellectual life, and of the exercises required
to develop it. It necessitates a concentration of intellectual
effort into four or six hours out of the twenty-four,
instead of a useless diffusion of intellectual peddling
over ten or twelve. It necessitates an extension of the
term of years allowed for education, and the giving up
the fashionable notion that a girl is to be &ldquo;finished&rdquo; at
seventeen or eighteen, while her brother continues to
pursue his studies until twenty-two or twenty-five. It
necessitates, finally, the most careful individual adjustment
to each different case; and to all its peculiarities,
mental, moral, and physical&mdash;quite as frequently, therefore,
necessitates the education of girls apart from one another
as apart from boys.</p>

<p>But this necessity is not permanent. Dr. Clarke himself
admits that if the one precaution upon which he insists
be observed during the first years of adolescence, it
will become unnecessary when the constitution is formed.
But neither Dr. Clarke nor his reviewers seem to see
that this admission annihilates the only objection made
by him to the co-education of the sexes. For that is especially
demanded as the only means by which women may
be enabled to enjoy a technically superior education, as
distinguished from the primary and secondary, and such
education does not begin until eighteen. A university
education is too expensive to be duplicated in any state;
it moreover represents the collective intellectual force of
society, and as such cannot rationally be cut in two. Indeed,
as such, cannot logically exclude women from men's
schools, which are thereby left as imperfect and incomplete
as would be the new universities to be constructed
exclusively for women. During the neutral period of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
childhood, girls and boys should be educated together,
because, as sex does not, properly speaking, exist, it is
absurd to base any distinctions upon it, and the attempt,
like all absurdities, is liable to lead to really disastrous
consequences. During the period of adolescence or of
the formation of sex, it is well to establish a separate
education, during which the character of each may be
defined and consolidated. This separation is needed by
the moral and the physical training rather than by the
intellectual. Were it, as is usually assumed, necessary
for boys to exercise and for girls to sit still, the need of
separation would be much less than it is, for the boys
could be sent to the gymnasium while the girls remained
in the school room. But systematic exercise is even
more necessary for the latter than for the former, because
they are likely to take it spontaneously. These exercises
must differ in kind and in intensity from those performed
by boys, and for this and other reasons, are best
pursued alone.</p>

<p>The moral differentiation of the sexes requires separate
education, for analogous reasons. Moral differences,
though less marked than physical, are more so than intellectual,
and any system of education that might be supposed
to efface these, would be an injury to society, that
requires, not uniformity, but increasing complexity, by
means of increasing variety of character among its members.
Thus the education of adolescent girls should include
certain training in the care of children, and other
duties that either permanently, or for the time being,
must fall to them and not to boys. But a more important
moral reason for separate education consists in
the desirability of prolonging as late as possible, the first
unconsciousness of sex. At this age the stimulus derived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
from co-education, acting upon imperfect organizations, is
liable to be other than intellectual&mdash;liable to excite
emotions equally ridiculous and painful from their pre-maturity,
and therefore to increase the very danger most
to be averted from this period of life&mdash;the excessive development
of the emotional functions and organs of the
nervous system.</p>

<p>But, by the age of eighteen, the reasons against the
co-education of the sexes have ceased to exist, and imperative
reasons in its favor have come into play. The first
we have already indicated. Unless the education of
girls be continued beyond the conventional retiring-point
of eighteen, and unless they be permitted access to the
State Universities, they cannot participate in the highest
intellectual education of the race. This cannot be
carried on by private teachers, in isolated classes, under
uncontrolled authorities. It must be public, national,
supreme&mdash;for it represents the collective intellectual force
of the nation; it is the work of society, and fits for
society; and the social influences presiding over its instruction
are as important as is the technical knowledge
conveyed in its system. Only the best minds should
be employed in its service, and in any State these are not
sufficiently numerous for the wants of indefinitely multiplied
schools.</p>

<p>But, further, if girls may be educated, and better educated,
apart from boys, it is scarcely possible to give women
an intellectual training apart from men, certainly in the
present generation. What may be lost to men by exclusion
from the intellectual companionship of women,
may perhaps be beyond the scope of our present subject
to inquire. But the loss sustained by women, who,
shut up in female academies, attempt, or pretend to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the attempt, to obtain a &ldquo;college education,&rdquo; is conspicuous
beyond possibility of cavil. The same peculiarities
that render women, as a rule, less original, are justly said
to make them more receptive, more malleable, more exquisitely
adjustable to the least variation of external
circumstance, or difference in the intellectual calibre of
their associates or masters. Their own intellects are
quickened to activity or repressed into torpor, by influences
that would have little effect upon the less impressionable,
more self-poised minds of men. These facts,
upon which great emphasis has often been laid, should
only lead to one inference, namely, that the education
and intellectual capacity of women is likely to remain
at the point, or advance to the degree at which men may
consider it desirable for it to exist; if, therefore, certain
conditions are seen to favor this advancement to an extraordinary
degree, and others to retard it in a manner as
extraordinary; if, in addition to results already achieved
by the increased education of women, others far greater
may be foreseen, when that education shall have become
really equal to that now accessible to men; it becomes
imperative to concede the conditions in question, unless
some equally imperative counter indication can be shown
to exist. Reasons of an entirely different order exist, we
think, in the fact that at this age the sexes naturally
seek each other's society, as much as they avoided it before.
It is difficult to see why this tendency requires to
be counteracted, except on some monastic principle that is
an unconscious &ldquo;survival&rdquo; from the middle ages.
Thwarting this tendency leads often to immorality in
the one sex&mdash;to languor, and mental, moral, and physical
debility in the other.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke places his counter indication almost exclusively
in the supposed necessity for a periodical intermit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>tence
in the intellectual work of women, that could not,
therefore, be brought into harmony with that of men.
But, as we have seen, Dr. Clarke himself admits that
such necessity is scarcely imperative except under the age
of eighteen or nineteen, and the period of study for
which co-education is really desirable, indeed, necessary,
does not begin until that age. Moreover, Dr. Clarke
draws his examples, not from students who have been
educated at mixed schools, but from those who have
attended ordinary girls' boarding-schools; so that no proof
is adduced of any special influence of co-education,
unless the general statement that &ldquo;co-education is intellectually
a success, physically a failure,&rdquo; can be considered
as such proof, which we do not believe. Since, according
to Dr. Clarke's own argument, the argument does
not apply to the particular point of controversy upon
which it has been made to bear with most force, it is
superfluous to return to our own reasonings, whereby we
believe to have shown that the dangers signalized, though
they exist, menace the minority and not the majority;
that they are then attributable, not to mental exertion,
but to the coincidences of mental exertion as at present
conducted; that they are to be averted, not by a single
man&#339;uvre, but by a general system of training, that
should include, instead of excluding, special attention to
intellectual development; that the results of such training
would remain, after the consolidation of the physical
health and the termination of the period of growth
had rendered further training unnecessary; whereas, the
peculiar precaution suggested by Dr. Clarke, would rather
tend to create a habit of body that would persist throughout
life, to immense inconvenience.</p>

<h2>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Recognizing the equality of both sexes to the highest
educational advantages,&rdquo; for four years the doors of
the University of Michigan have been &ldquo;open to all
students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The University is organized in three departments,
as follows: the Department of Literature, Science, and
the Arts; the Department of Medicine and Surgery;
the Department of Law. Each department has its
Faculty of Instruction, who are charged with its special
management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eager to avail themselves of the advantages here offered
in such a &ldquo;broad, generous, and hospitable spirit,&rdquo; a
number of women from different parts of the country
have matriculated, and are or have been pursuing studies
in common with students of the other sex.</p>

<p>During the four years three women have graduated
from the Literary Department, four from the Law, and
twenty-one from the Medical. At the present time
there are in the first department above mentioned, fifty
women; in the second, five; and in the third, thirty-eight.</p>

<p>Of those in the Law and Medical Departments I can
say comparatively little. The general impression is,
that they have endured the work quite as well as the
men; and it is a fact, that a number of the women who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
entered the Medical Department, with four lectures per
day to attend, and all the work of the laboratory and
dissecting-room to perform, have steadily improved in
health from the time of entering until leaving; while
those who were well at the beginning of their college
work, have in no case suffered a deterioration of health
from their intellectual labor. One of these women, Miss
Emma Call, of Boston, graduated last year, the first in
her class.</p>

<p>Thus far the women-graduates from this department
have generally taken positions in their profession which
they are filling with usefulness, if not with honor; and
in which, as far as powers of endurance are concerned,
they are showing themselves able to compete with male
physicians. There seems to be an impression prevalent
among them&mdash;and perhaps it is not peculiar to their sex
alone&mdash;that the physician should be the physiological
educator as well as the healer of the race, that his or her
duty is to teach people how to use the &ldquo;ounce of prevention&rdquo;
as well as the &ldquo;pound of cure,&rdquo; and that,
through the mutual labors of the two sexes, more than
in any other way, is to be brought about the long-desired,
and much-needed, health reform.</p>

<p>Although it may yet be too early to form an estimate
of the effect of this system of &ldquo;identical co-education&rdquo;
upon the health of the women who have graduated from
this University, we believe that there has been only one
case of protracted illness, and there is no reason for asserting
that this was caused by intellectual labor&mdash;at least,
in this institution, since the lady was here only six
months&mdash;having taken her previous course elsewhere&mdash;and
is a graduate from the Law Department.</p>

<p>Of those who have graduated from the Literary De<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>partment,
we have positive information that as yet they
have suffered no &ldquo;penalties&rdquo; from their &ldquo;severe and
long-continued mental labor,&rdquo; and they were, on graduating,
as well as on entering. One woman who matriculated
with the present senior class, took the whole course
in three years, went forth in better health than when she
entered, and is at present the principal of the High
School at Mankato, Minn., while another is still prosecuting
her studies, and contemplates taking a course of
law.</p>

<p>In regard to those at present in the Literary Department,
it is impossible to get at any statistics as to excused
absences, which will show the average attendance
of one sex as compared with that of the other, and from
which inferences can be deduced in regard to the health
of the women-students; for the university authorities&mdash;not
having dreamed that there was a &ldquo;new natural
law&rdquo; to be revealed, which should assert that the course
of &ldquo;identical co-education&rdquo; is conducive to health and
usefulness for the one sex, and to premature decay and the
hospital or cemetery for the other&mdash;have not preserved
the records of excused absences. The professors assert
that non-attendance upon recitations, on account of ill-health,
has been no greater on the part of the young
women than of the young men, and that in many
cases, the attendance of the former has been better than
that of the latter; yet there is nothing, perhaps, except
personal acquaintance and observation, which can reveal
the true condition of the present health of the women of
the Literary Department of Michigan University, and
the manner in which it has been affected by the
intellectual labors they have undergone.</p>

<p>In the present graduating class, there are eight women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
who have been, at all times during the college course, as
well as an equal number of their classmates, or the same
number of women in any pursuit in life. One of these,
who is not only the 'picture of health,' but who is perfectly
healthy, was only sixteen years of age when she
entered. Two other young women, who have ranked
with the first of their class in scholarship, and who have
been in excellent health during the entire course, with
the exception of slight illnesses in their freshman year&mdash;not
caused by study&mdash;who are now among the most
healthy of their class, have, in addition to their college
work, nearly defrayed their expenses by teaching during
the vacations, by giving private instruction after study
hours, and by working in various other ways. They
have not, in this fourth year of almost double duty, any
lurking disease which threatens to impair or to destroy
their usefulness in the future, and they are as strong,
ambitious, and happy as when they entered.</p>

<p>One who entered the class in its sophomore year,
and who intended to graduate with it, was obliged
to withdraw on account of her health; but those
who know her best cannot assert that this was caused,
either directly or indirectly, by her intellectual labors,
or that, under the same conditions, the same results
would not have followed from any kind of work. She
was, and had been for a long time before entering, in a
very bad state of health, and was utterly unfit for study.</p>

<p>Thus far, the health record of the women of this class
has compared favorably with that of the men, and there
is, at the present time, no physiological reason why it
should not thus continue even 'down to old age.'</p>

<p>The class of '75 had, on entering, eleven women. Of
these, one has died, an apparently healthy girl, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
passed from us in the second year of her college life,
shortly after her return in the autumn. We do not
know the cause of her sickness, but we do know that
it was not the result of overtaxed mental powers, since
it occurred but a little while after the long vacation of
the summer, and the disease was one which had carried
off a number of members of the same family in former
years, viz., typhoid fever, alike unsparing of age, sex, or
condition. With this exception, this class has been
remarkably healthy, and with but a slight exception is,
at the present time, perfectly so. Their attendance on
recitations has been uniformly good, above the average
of the classes, and they have done excellent work. Of
these, two were sixteen years of age on entering, one was
twenty, and the others varied in ages between sixteen
and twenty. Concerning one of the former, President
Angell had some misgivings when she entered, as she
did not seem to be very strong; but she is now in her
third year in the University, and her mother informed
the president not long since that the health of her
daughter had improved since she came to Ann Arbor,
and that the nervous headaches by which she had been
formerly troubled had entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Among those who matriculated with the class of '76,
were seventeen young women, two of whom were in
poor health at the time, and physically unfit for work.
One was ill for some time last winter with rheumatism,
and compelled to suspend her labors, and the other was
obliged to leave college. The former is now teaching,
and will probably return, and the other has resumed
her studies, but is far from being well. One of the
number, who is from the Sandwich Islands, was sick
four weeks with inflammation of the lungs; but her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
brother, who is one year in advance of her, was also sick
in his freshman year with the same disease, the only
difference being that she was ill four weeks, and he,
seven.</p>

<p>As a class, the 'sophomore girls' are in even a better
physical condition in the middle of this their second
year, the hardest year of the course, than they were at
the beginning of last year. One of them, with charming
<i>naivet&eacute;</i> asserts that she was 'miserable' when she entered,
and her father sent her to the University to 'see
if she wouldn't get well;' and she 'has been getting
well ever since.'</p>

<p>The average attendance of the young women of this
class upon recitations, is also fully equal to that of the
young men, judging from the stand-point of the professors;
and in the classical sections it has been better.</p>

<p>In the present Freshman class, there are also seventeen
young women, most of whom are under twenty years of
age; as also are most of those of the other classes on entering.
Of those in this class there is little to be said,
as they have been with us but a few months. They appear
to be well and strong. Many of them are graduates
from the high schools of the State, and a large
proportion from the Ann Arbor High School. In regard
to his graduates, Professor Perry, the Superintendent
of Schools in this city, gives the following statistics
in regard to sixteen young men and nine young
women who graduated last year:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Graduated Last Year">

</table></div>

<p>It is a fact that thus far the women of Michigan University
have demonstrated a principle of Dr. Tappan's&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
former president of the University&mdash;that brain-work
is good for the health. If the seeds of future disease
have been in some mysterious manner implanted in their
systems, it is in no sense apparent except to the imaginations
of those who are least acquainted with our girls.
The points which I wish to establish are these: that
their health has been as good as that of their classmates;
that those who were in a proper condition on entering
have in no respect suffered a deterioration of health from
their intellectual work; that of those who were not in a
proper condition for this or any other kind of work, and
have been obliged to withdraw from college, there have
been only two&mdash;a no larger per cent than the records
of the young men would show; that although we have
lost one by death, they have lost several; and that
the ordinary brain-work required of the intelligent, ambitious
students of Michigan University, if they are
prepared in all respects for it, is conducive to health. Too
much attention cannot be given to the importance of a
thorough preparation. With it, students who were not
especially strong, have gone on with constantly improving
health; without it, even the strongest have felt that
the burdens imposed by their studies were heavy&mdash;and
this is true of one sex as well as of the other.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>I quote also from the editorial of the college paper,
which is conducted entirely by the young men, to give the
view from another stand-point, where, in speaking of
&ldquo;college girls,&rdquo; the writer says: &ldquo;They pertinaciously
keep their health and strength in a way that is aggravating,
and they persist in evincing a capability for
close and continued mental labor, which, to the ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
estimator of woman's brain-power, seems like pure willfulness.
They have, with a generally noticeable peculiarity,
disappointed the most oracular prognostications.&rdquo;
The general verdict of those outside the
university is, that &ldquo;the girls are holding out remarkably
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And perhaps it may be asked, &ldquo;What are our habits
of life?&rdquo; Possibly the best reply may be given in the
words of Hamerton, from <i>Intellectual Life</i>, where in
speaking of Kant, he says: &ldquo;In his manner of living he
did not consult custom, but the needs of his individual
nature.&rdquo; Thus is it here. Our healthiest girls are those
who have come from healthful homes, from wise and
judicious parents, who, having instilled into their minds
the true principles of right living, have not hesitated to
send them forth to the university where the experiment
of co-education is being tried, feeling that
they would adapt everything to the needs of their individual
natures, and they are showing themselves to be
so doing. Sometimes sisters come together, sometimes
a brother and sister, and in a few instances the parents
have come here to reside during the college course of
their children.</p>

<p>But the habits of the young women are generally regular.
They indulge in little party-going, or dissipation;
they have work to do, and to it they give their best
strength. As a rule, they dress healthfully, are not
ashamed to show that they can take a long breath without
causing stitches to rip, or hooks to fly; they do not
disdain dresses that are too short for street-sweeping;
they have learned that the shoulders are better for sustaining
the heavy skirts than the hips, and they are finding
that, especially in this climate, healthful though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
is, one must be prepared with suitable clothing for all
the exigencies of the weather.</p>

<p>Their study-life is quiet and happy. Their rooms are
in private houses, usually rented in suites of two, with
plenty of light and ventilation, and with bright, pleasant
furniture. The people with whom they live are very
kind, and take a great interest in the young strangers
who come among them. They board either with the
family, or in clubs,&mdash;as most of the young men do, and
with them; and somehow there is among them little of
that false appetite for indigestible food, usually so prevalent
among young women who are at a boarding-school,
or living away from home.</p>

<p>There are no regularly prescribed study-hours, and
there is no regularly prescribed exercise. Most of the
young women have rooms some distance from University
Hall, to which they are generally obliged to go two or
three times a day, so that they, of necessity, have considerable
walking&mdash;in which some of those here have
shown remarkable powers of strength and endurance.</p>

<p>In fact, there is nothing prescribed for the student,
except lessons; the only authority which the university
assumes is intellectual authority, and nothing is compulsory
except attendance upon recitations, and a proper
attention to the prescribed work.</p>

<p>Perhaps the principal cause for the good health of the
young women, and their ability to endure the work they
have entered upon, is the fact that they have an aim in
life beyond the mere fact of graduating from a great
university; they believe that there is a future before
them, in which they are to do a woman's work, in a
manner all the nobler and better for the advantages of
this higher education, and as they advance toward its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
opening portals, the step becomes firmer, the form more
erect, the eye more radiant; they believe, also, that the
divine call has come for woman to be something more
than the clinging vine, or the nodding lily; that
delicacy is a word of mockery when applied to health, a
word of beauty when applied to cultivated perceptions,
and refined tastes.</p>

<p>They enjoy their work; they have the confidence
of their professors, the esteem of their classmates, and
the love of one another. Their work is to them more
attractive than the charms of society; their Greek and
Latin more entertaining than the modern novel; their
mathematics no more intricate than the fancy-work
which used to be considered one of the necessary things
in a woman's education; and most of them have minds
of their own, with a good supply of common sense.</p>

<p>But perhaps, after all, little can be inferred for
the future from the result of four years of co-education
in Michigan University, from the intellectual
and moral standing of the women who are at
the present time students here, or from their physical
well-being. We do not assert that there can be; we do
not draw inferences, we present facts. We are fully
aware that the problem of co-education is in the first
stages of its solution; that it will require at least a generation
to solve it fully; that faith is not fruition,
nor belief, certainty in this experiment, any more than
in any other; that while the women who are here at the
present time are earnest, conscientious, and high-minded,
those who come after them may be far different; and
that even those who go forth in these first years may
break down at the first stroke of future work, even as
some of their brothers have done; but we do assert that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
as far as Michigan University is concerned, educating a
girl in a boy's way has thus far been proven to be
better than any girl's way yet discovered, and there
has appeared no reason why the good effects should not
continue.</p>

<p>We are sometimes made to feel, in a manner intended
to be humiliating, that we are trespassing upon ground
foreign to our natures, in thus seeking the higher education
in a domain which has hitherto belonged, almost
exclusively, to man&mdash;but in all cases this has been done
by those outside of our university; and while we know
that they who thus speak and write are those who consider
themselves the best friends to woman in the spheres
to which they would limit her, we also know that all
true friends of progress are friends to the highest culture
of man or woman. We know, too, that for the
manner in which we obey the dictates of our natures,
implanted there by 'One who is mightier than we are,'
we alone are accountable.</p>

<p>We know the barriers, real and fancied, which are
supposed to stand in the way; the arduous toil upon
which we enter, the responsibilities which we assume;
but for all this, the woman of Michigan University goes
forth brave, earnest, and loyal to the dictates of duty;
she expects to do work in life as a woman whose womanliness
has been but intensified and glorified by these
four years of co-education; whose health shall be
all that Nature intended it should be, and who will, in
the truest sense possible, strive</p>

<h2>MOUNT HOLYOKE.</h2>

<p>The Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was opened in
1837. During the thirty-six years ending July 3, 1873,
it has graduated one thousand four hundred and fifty-five
young women.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Its founder aimed to provide a permanent
institution, where the best advantages should be
offered at a moderate expense, and whose entire culture
should tend to produce, not only thorough students and
skilful teachers, but earnest, efficient, Christian women.
Accordingly, its course of study has always given prominence
to the solid rather than to the showy, omitting
mostly what are termed ornamental branches, and devoting
the more time to studies which give mental discipline.
There is no preparatory department. In order to enter,
pupils are required to pass examination in English Grammar
and Analysis, Modern Geography, History of the
United States, Mental and Written Arithmetic, Elementary
Algebra, Physical Geography, Latin Grammar and
Latin Reader. The course of study was originally arranged
for three years, but since 1862 requires four. No
pupils are received under sixteen years of age, and none
are admitted to the senior class under eighteen, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
majority are considerably older. The age at the time of
graduating averages something over twenty-one years.
None are received as day-scholars.</p>

<p>The amount of intellectual labor required is about six
hours a day; that is, two recitations of forty-five minutes
each, and four hours and a half spent in study. As a
rule, only two studies are pursued at a time. There are
but four recitation days in the week, a fifth being devoted
to composition and general business. The day of recreation
is Wednesday, an arrangement which is somewhat
unusual, and might not be convenient for schools composed
in part of day-scholars. Here, however, the holiday
interposed in the middle of the week serves to lessen
the danger of too protracted application to study, and
makes the last two recitation days as easy as the first.</p>

<p>The health of the pupils is under the care of the lady
physician residing in the family. She is assisted by a
teacher who superintends the diet and nursing of invalids.
Besides the frequent suggestions in regard to the care of
health, which the Principal addresses to the school,
special instructions are given by the physician to her
classes in physiology. The pupils are particularly cautioned
against exposure of health by insufficient protection
of the person from cold or dampness, by running
up or down stairs, or by sleeping in unventilated rooms.
All are required to retire before ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and advised to
choose an earlier hour as far as practicable. Daily out-door
exercise, for at least half an hour, is required, except
when inclement weather or ill-health may prevent.
Light gymnastics are practised by all except individuals
who have been permanently excused by the physician.
All are directed, however, to abstain from gymnastics
at certain periods, as well as from long walks, or severe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
physical exertion of any kind. It has not been found
that regular and moderate study at such times is injurious
to girls in ordinary health. The pupil is always
excused from lessons if she finds herself unable to study,
which of course may often be the case with those of delicate
and excitable temperament, or unsound health.</p>

<p>It is generally known that the ordinary house-work of
the seminary family is performed by the young ladies,
under the supervision of the teachers and matrons. But
so many erroneous ideas have prevailed in regard to the
amount of labor required of each pupil, that it seems
necessary here to repeat explanations often given before.</p>

<p>Each young lady spends, upon an average, one hour a
day in domestic work. The length of time varies a little,
according to the kind of work; the more laborious or
less agreeable tasks being proportionately shorter than
the light and easy ones. The time occupied varies thus
from forty-five to seventy minutes a day. On the
Sabbath, only about half an hour's work is required,
while on Wednesday an additional half hour is necessary.
Usually one keeps the same work for a term or
more, unless some interference with recitations, or
other personal reason, makes a change advisable. Pupils
are excused from their domestic work whenever their
health requires it, the place being temporarily supplied
from a sort of reserve corps, who have no regular places
of their own.</p>

<p>The benefit to the health, of having a little daily exercise
in doing house-work, was one of several considerations
in view of which this plan was originally adopted. This
opinion is supported by long experience, and has also
the sanction of high medical authority. Dr. Nathan
Allen of Lowell remarks in his essay upon <i>Physical</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
<i>Degeneracy</i>, page 16; &ldquo;No kind of exercise or work whatever
is so well calculated to improve the constitution and
health of females as domestic labor. By its lightness,
repetition, and variety, it is peculiarly adapted to call into
wholesome exercise all the muscles and organs of the
body, producing an exuberance of health, vigor of frame,
power of endurance, and elasticity of spirits; and to all
these advantages are to be added the best possible domestic
habits, and a sure and enduring foundation for the
highest moral and intellectual culture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pupils often remark a decided improvement in their
health under the combined influences of moderate and
systematic mental labor, judicious exercise, both out of
doors and within, and regular hours for eating and
sleeping. It should not be forgotten, however, that
among any three hundred girls, there will be many
slight ailments in the course of a year, if not some cases
of serious illness. Being at best inexperienced, as well
as excitable and impulsive, girls are liable to expose
their health in a thousand ways, notwithstanding all that
careful mothers or teachers can do. Mere physical robustness
is of far less account in carrying one through an
extended course of study than prudence and good sense.
Many a girl possessing these traits, though naturally
delicate, has not only completed the Holyoke course with
honor, but has found herself all the better able to meet
the duties of more laborious years, on account of the
systematic habits and practical efficiency acquired here.
It is much better not to begin the course earlier than
eighteen, on account of the greater maturity then to be
expected, not only of the physical constitution, but also
of the judgment, on which the preservation of health so
largely depends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>The following statistics show the comparative longevity
of graduates from Mount Holyoke Seminary, and from
a number of colleges for young men. In each case they
include a period of thirty years, closing generally with
1867, or within a year or two of that date. They were
originally compiled early in 1868, and embraced all the
classes which had then graduated at Mount Holyoke.
The war mortality is excluded in every case where it was
separately stated in the college Triennial, as indicated
below.</p>

As these statistics were compiled immediately after
the close of the period embraced, there must have been,
in every case, some deaths not then ascertained, which
subsequent Triennials include. For example, the Amherst
Triennial of 1869 makes the number graduated during
the thirty years ending in 1867, 1,203; deceased to that
date, 152 (besides deaths in the war); percentage of
mortality, 12.63. In like manner the record of Mount
Holyoke, revised early in 1870, makes the number of
deaths during the above period 139, and the rate per
cent 11.46. This, however, does not materially affect
the comparison, in regard to which it was remarked by
Dr. Nathan Allen, in the <i>Congregationalist</i> of June 23,
1870. &ldquo;This Seminary shows a better record than all the
colleges except Williams.&rdquo; Dr. Edward Hitchcock, of
Amherst, in the <i>Springfield Republican</i> of May 2, 1870,
also says: &ldquo;By these results we learn that it becomes
those to be careful who state that all female schools are
injurious to the health of their students. For here is
one which, in attainments of scholarship, general discipline,
and religious culture, has ranked among the highest,
and yet its health-influence holds out better than in
gentlemen's schools of kindred grade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lady physician formerly connected with this Seminary,
speaking of customs of modern society which have
impaired women's powers of endurance, remarks: &ldquo;The
most pernicious of these customs is certainly improper
dress, viz., tight lacing, long and heavy skirts dragging
from the hips, and the great weight of clothing upon the
lower portion of the back; also, insufficient covering of
the lower extremities.&rdquo; The present physician attributes
perhaps the greater part of the ill-health from which
young ladies suffer, to these errors in dress. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
fruitful source of evil, for which parents are largely responsible,
is the supplying of school-girls with quantities
of rich pastry, cakes and sweetmeats, which are eaten, of
course, between meals, and often just before going to bed.
In one instance a young lady, previously in perfect health,
in the course of two years made herself a confirmed dyspeptic,
simply by indulging night after night in the indigestible
dainties with which she was constantly supplied
from home. This is her own view of the matter in looking
back.</p>

<p>The following words from the two lady physicians
who have been longest connected with the Seminary,
give the results of their professional experience there:</p>

<br />
<p>Extracts from the letter of Dr. (Belden) Taylor, formerly
physician at Mt. Holyoke Seminary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In regard to regular study producing pain, h&aelig;morrhage
or irregularity, I do not think these disturbances
are caused so much by application to study as by want of
care and prudence at the menstrual period, and of fresh
air and exercise during the interval. * * * I think that
labor, both mental and physical, should be diminished at
the menstrual period, for at this time the ovaries and
uterus are intensely engorged, and the nervous system is
in an unusually excitable condition. Do not understand
me that girls should be excused from all physical labor,
but only that they should not undertake unusually hard
work, and should avoid long walks, giving themselves as
much rest as possible. * * * I do not think, however,
that any of these things should debar a woman from pursuing
a regular course of study, only let her exercise care
and prudence at the menstrual period. It is not uncommon
for this function to be arrested by any great change
of circumstances, as when a girl leaves home and goes to
school, where there is almost an entire change of habits.
Many cases came under my observation while at the
Seminary, among the junior class (first year), of suppression
or irregularity for three or six months, all then
proceeding regularly without medical interference. I
think women suffering from ordinary female troubles are
benefited by regular exercise; for a want of proper exercise
affects injuriously the general health, thereby increasing
the uterine disorder. If a girl with any <i>great</i>
female trouble should enter the Seminary, her troubles
would be increased, not from the regular work, but by
going over the stairs.&rdquo;</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>Letter from Mrs. Arnold, of Milwaukee, formerly Dr.
Homer, physician at Mt. Holyoke Seminary in 1860-64:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;A large number of cases of irregularity in the form
of suppression, were always met with during the first
year, especially the first months of that year. Often the
health was not seriously affected, and the trouble would
right itself or readily yield to mild remedies. Had this
derangement been caused by hard study in the pursuance
of a regular course, it would have been most common
among pupils in advanced classes. The fact that it was
not, shows that it must be accounted for in some other
way. Neither do we need to look far. There is change
of circumstances, of employments, of diet, of sleep; often
of climate, many coming from a distance, and, more than
all, coming from quiet homes to dwell in such a large
family, where there is enough of novelty and excitement
to keep them constantly interested&mdash;perhaps I should
say absorbed&mdash;in new directions. It is common for
change to produce like results elsewhere, as well as in
school life, especially during the early years of womanhood.
Again, those thus affected are quite as likely to
be the dull or inattentive as the studious.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Cases of excessive or painful menstruation were far
less numerous, and had their origin also in other causes
than hard study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the effect of regular brain-work upon those
already suffering from diseases peculiar to the sex, I do
not recall any cases where the mere matter of intellectual
labor had any effect to increase the trouble. Other
circumstances connected with school life might aggravate
such complaints, <i>e.g.</i>, much going over stairs, but
a temperate application to study, even of the sterner
kinds, by giving occupation to the mind, I consider
highly beneficial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great cause of diseases incidental only to the
female sex is to be found in want of sensible, intelligent
thought, and an unwillingness to act in accordance with
the convictions such thought would bring. The follies
and frivolities of fashionable life slay their thousands
where hard study slays its one. Tight-lacing, I believe,
was never more prevalent than at the present time, and
its victims are a host. * * * This matter of dress, so
difficult to be reformed, has a very large share in making
women weak and helpless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it cannot be denied that many young
women come out of school with broken health. Do not
young men also? The fact that so many girls are enfeebled
by the course pursued with them from their very
infancy, easily accounts for their broken health, without
attributing it at all to study. It cannot but be apparent
to any one, that a feeble, sickly girl or boy is unfit to
attempt a severe course of study. Again, girls are often
in such a hurry to 'finish,' that they overdo, and suffer
the consequences in after life.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It has long been my opinion that we are in danger of
pushing the 'graded school system' too far. There
should be more latitude allowed, more optional studies in
all our schools. The question may be asked, Does not
this system bear equally upon boys and girls? If so, why
do girls suffer more in health? I affirm, not because of
the difference physically, but because the custom of
society shuts the girl up in the house&mdash;to her books, if
she is conscientious, and she is more likely to be so than
her brother&mdash;while the boy is turned loose, to have just
as good a time as if he were at the other end of his
class. * * * When we attempt to compare the ability
of the two sexes to endure the strain of continuous mental
work, there are many circumstances to be considered,
many things that are not as they should be. If women
were trained from their infancy as they might be, and as
they ought to be, there would be no need of arguing.
But so long as the present fetters of fashion and custom
are submitted to, the question will remain unsettled.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>OBERLIN COLLEGE.</h2>

<p>Dr Clarke's experience and success as a physician give
him a right to speak, and that with the tone of authority.
He has spoken, and in such clear and unmistakable words
that all must hear, the startling truth, that American
women are sickly women; that proofs of this fact are
not confined to any class or condition, but that &ldquo;everywhere,
on the luxurious couches of Beacon Street, in the
palaces of Fifth Avenue, among the classes of our private,
common, and Normal schools, among the female
graduates of our colleges, behind the counters of Washington
Street, on Broadway, in our factories, workshops
and homes,&rdquo; pale, weak women are the rule, and not the
exception. This is the one permanent impression which
the book makes. It is for this reason that we are thankful.
It matters not that the presenting of this fact was
not the author's main object. It matters still less, that
he failed in his object; for, if his theory had been a true
theory, and he had succeeded in convincing the world of
its truthfulness, he would have benefited but a small
class of our American people. Only a few women, comparatively,
are found in our colleges and higher schools
of learning.</p>

<p>Man often means one thing while God means another.
Luther meant to reform the Roman Church&mdash;God meant
to reform the world. Dr. Clarke meant, as he tells us
in his preface, to excite discussion, and stimulate inves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>tigation,
with regard to the relation of sex to education;
but he has excited a discussion, and stimulated an investigation,
that, unless Ephraim is wholly joined to
his idols, will not stop until a reform has been wrought
in our whole social system. Not only in our colleges
and universities, but in our lower grades of schools;
and&mdash;as he has taught us that the head is not all, but
the body a good deal&mdash;in our food, in our times of
downsitting and uprising, in our hours of retiring, in
the ventilation of our churches, public halls and private
homes. We are at last to understand, what it is so hard
for an American to understand, that to wait is sometimes
as much a duty as to work.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke meant to prove, that co-education, in the
popular signification of that term, for physiological
reasons, is an impossibility. He succeeded, as he thinks,
theoretically, but failed, as he confesses, practically, for
the want of sufficient data. What he indirectly proved
was of much more vital importance, because it affects the
whole nation; that, for physiological reasons, American
women, and consequently the American people, cannot
live at this high-pressure rate, which means death. The
universal interest which his book has awakened, the
rapidly following reviews and criticisms, the numerous
essays which have since been published, on the same
and kindred subjects, show that thinking minds were
already working their way to definite conclusions and expression
on this now most important of all subjects&mdash;how
to give back to the American woman the bloom and
physical strength, the elasticity and fresh old age which
are hers by the right of inheritance.</p>

<p>No one will deny Dr. Clarke's statement, that, with
the best of opportunities, she does not in these respects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
compare favorably with her trans-Atlantic sisters. But
we are not willing to admit that the strength of the
German <i>fr&auml;ulein</i> and English damsel must be purchased
at so great a sacrifice as the giving up of all systematic
study, and consequently of all higher intellectual
development.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sacred number three,&rdquo; which we are told &ldquo;dominates
the human frame,&rdquo; dominates also the whole being.
There is the physical, the moral, and the mental; and
we are not to cast such a reflection upon the Author of
our being, as to suppose that the proper development of
the one must be at the expense of the other. If God
demands more of woman's physical nature than of man's,
he has wisely provided for it, within that nature. Faith
in his benevolence leads us to this conclusion. It is just
as true, that where much will be required, much has been
given, as that where much has been given, much will be
required. When woman learns the laws which govern
her physical nature, and has the courage to live in accordance
with those laws, it will be found that she has
strength to be a woman, a Christian and a scholar. It is
just as true in her case as in man's, that proper brain
activity stimulates physical activity.</p>

<p>There are many sickly girls to be found in our schools,
but they are often sickly when they come to us; often,
too, under the seeming garb of health, the seeds of disease
are already germinating, and it is time, not study,
which brings them to the surface.</p>

<p>When mothers are able to send us strong, healthy
girls, with simple habits and unperverted tastes, we will
return to them and the world strong, healthy women,
fitted, physically and mentally, for woman's work.</p>

<p>It is continuous education, not co-education, which Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Clarke really condemns; but every teacher knows that
continuity of effort is essential to sound mental development,
and that this off-and-on method, which he seems
to recommend, would destroy all order in the school, and
make all work in the class-room impossible. If, then,
his theory&mdash;that for physiological reasons girls cannot
endure continuous study&mdash;is the true theory, not only
our colleges and universities ought to remain closed
against women, but all our schools for girls over fourteen
years of age ought to be closed also, and the pupils sent
home, to receive such instruction as they can from private
teachers, at such times as their bodies can afford to lend
time to their heads.</p>

<p>We say <i>ought</i>, and we mean what we say; for we are
not &ldquo;so professionally committed to a dangerous experiment&rdquo;
as to insist upon it, if once convinced that it is
dangerous; neither are we &ldquo;urgent reformers, who care
less for human suffering and human life, than for the
trial of a theory.&rdquo; Dr. Clarke believes, &ldquo;if the causes
which have brought about the present ill-health of
American women continue for the next half century,
and increase in the same ratio as they have for the last
fifty years, that we shall cease to be an American people.&rdquo;
We believe it, too; but we do not believe, as he does,
that the chief causes of this ill-health are to be laid at
the doors of our seminaries and colleges. We believe
that more girls are benefited than are injured by the
regimen of a well-regulated school, and our belief is
founded upon years of observation. The number is not
small, of girls, who have come to us pale, nervous and
laboring under many of the ills of which Dr. Clarke
speaks, to whom the regularity which must be observed
in a large school, but, most of all, the stimulus of sys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>tematic
brain-work upon the body, has proved most
sanitary.</p>

<p>The mother of one young lady placed her under our
care a year and a half ago, saying, as she did so: &ldquo;My
daughter has always been frail. I greatly fear she will
not be able to endure regular school work. Send her
home at any time, if convinced that her health suffers
from school discipline.&rdquo; While her health has been
steadily improving, she has been able to gain an enviable
position in her class. One of her professors said that
he had never heard more finished recitations than hers.
This is only one instance, where we might give many,
of the quickening influence of brain-work upon the body,
and we have often heard the same testimony given by
other teachers.</p>

<p>Of course, we do not claim that sick girls ought to
study, any more than sick boys, or that there are, at the
present time, as many girls who can endure hard study,
either spasmodic or continuous, as boys. We accept the
fact, that American women are sickly women; we only
protest against the false theory that makes our higher
schools responsible for the fact.</p>

<p>In Dr. Clarke's chapter upon co-education, we read
that &ldquo;this experiment&rdquo;&mdash;meaning co-education&mdash;&ldquo;has
been tried in some of our western Colleges, but has not
been tried long enough to show much more than its first-fruits,
viz., its results while the students are in college;
and of these, the only obvious ones are increased emulation,
and intellectual development and attainments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wondering how long it must be tried before it ceases
to be an experiment, we read on a few pages, when we
are told that &ldquo;two or three generations, at least, of the
female college graduates of this sort of co-education, must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
come and go before any sufficient idea can be formed of
the harvest it will yield.&rdquo; Is it not rather dangerous to
wait two or three generations for the result of an experiment,
when it affects so important a question as our
national life? But what if the experiment has been
already tried? What if we can show by actual figures
that, in addition to the increased intellectual development
and attainments, time has proved that there has
also been physical strength &ldquo;to stand the wear and tear
of woman's work in life?&rdquo; If we can have intellectual
development and physical activity combined, is it not a
thing to be devoutly wished? If there is any other conclusion
to be truthfully reached, than the one which
obliges a woman to feel that, for the good of the race,
she must content her longings after knowledge with only
a few crumbs from the rich banquet which is spread
temptingly before her, why put her faith in the justice
of God to such a test?</p>

<p>It is this conclusion, and conclusions like this, spoken
in the tone of authority, which have sometimes made
weak women &ldquo;speak of their physical organization with
half-smothered anathemas,&rdquo; and led them &ldquo;to be ashamed
of the temple&rdquo; which an all-loving, and, let us also add,
an all-wise Father, has built for them.</p>

<p>If, in the place of this conclusion, against which all a
woman's instincts rebel, we may truthfully teach her
that there is no antagonism between her body and her
brain, and that, for the good of the race, she ought
systematically to develop both, we remove all stumbling
blocks from her way, we lighten her burdens, we make
her brave to endure, because our teachings correspond
with all her preconceived ideas of justice and benevolence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this view of the subject, rather than any belief
in the modern theories of woman's sphere, that led the
founders of Oberlin College to open her doors to women.
She has tried the experiment for nearly two generations.
Her last annual catalogue contained the names
of over one hundred students, whose fathers' or mothers'
names can be found in some earlier catalogue. Let us
see with what results; for these are the data which Dr.
Clarke says we must have, before we can reach any
definite conclusion.</p>

<p>Oberlin has graduated, as shown by her last Triennial
Catalogue, published in 1873, 579 men and 620 women.
This does not include the 126 men from the Theological
Seminary. Ninety-five women have graduated from the
full classical course, and received the first degree in the
arts, 525 from the &ldquo;Women's Course.&rdquo; But lest some
should conclude from this name, that it stands for a
diluted curriculum, suited to the weakened condition of
woman's brain, or rather, her body&mdash;since we have it upon
the best authority that her brain, under the most powerful
microscope, shows no inferiority to man's&mdash;we will
add, that the trustees of the college, at their last annual
meeting, discussed the question of changing the name,
and conferring a degree upon those completing this
course, as Michigan University confers a degree upon
those completing its Latin Scientific Course. The subject
was referred to the Faculty, to be reported upon at the
next Commencement.</p>

<p>Now, what of these 620 women, to whom Oberlin has
given the privileges of a higher intellectual development?
How have they stood the &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo;?
Surely they have been put to the test, for few of them
have led inactive lives. Their names are to be found as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
teachers in our common schools; in our high-schools and
seminaries, from Mexico to the woods of Canada; from
the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic; in our lists of missionaries,
both in the home and foreign field; as professors
in Female Medical Colleges; as founders of asylums
and homes of refuge, and as leaders in all benevolent
enterprises.</p>

<p>Now it is a law of nature, that where there is an imperfect
development there is a tendency to early decay.
If, then, the evils of continuous education for girls be as
great as Dr. Clarke thinks, we should naturally expect to
find more deaths among the Alumn&aelig; than among the
Alumni of Oberlin. We turn again to the Triennial,
and count the starred names. There are 60 among the
former and 59 among the latter, making the per cent
of deaths for the female graduates, 9.67; for the male
graduates, a little over 10. But it should be mentioned
that there were no women in the first class, so that, as
near as may be, the rates of mortality are the same. The
number of deaths among the 95 women who have graduated
from the full classical course, is 10, making the
per cent 9.5.</p>

<p>We see nothing here &ldquo;to excite the grave alarm,&rdquo; but
we do see something &ldquo;to demand the serious attention
of the community.&rdquo; If the question, whether girls can endure
continuous education&mdash;which really means whether
they shall be educated at all beyond the mere rudiments
and polite nothings&mdash;is to be decided, such facts as these,
to those who are honestly looking for the truth, mean
more than pages of theorizing.</p>

<p>But some one says, tell us of the health of these 620
women. How many are hopeless invalids, dragging out
&ldquo;tedious days and still more tedious nights&rdquo;? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
limits of this essay would preclude the possibility of
giving the individual history of each, even if it were
known to us; but because facts here are worth so much
more than general statements, and because Dr. Clarke
says it is data that must decide this question, I have
concluded to give the individual history, so far as known
to me, of the Class of '56. Not because there is anything
peculiar in its history, but because it is my own
class, and I therefore know more about it. I take the
names in alphabetical order, and call the roll:</p>

<p>The first answers from Buffalo, where, as a minister's
wife, she finds ample opportunity to exercise all her
powers. She reports good health.</p>

<p>The second is unmarried, and a teacher. For some
years she has been working among the freedmen's schools
at the South. When I last saw her, some five months
since, she appeared the embodiment of good cheer and
sound nerves.</p>

<p>The third was for eleven years a teacher in a private
seminary in New York. A part of that time she had
the entire charge of the school. During the whole time
she lost but two months from sickness. She is now in
good health, and enjoying home life.</p>

<p>The fourth does not answer to any roll-call here. She
came to us clad in mourning. Consumption had robbed
her of a mother and sister, and we always felt that her
hold upon life was slight. The years added somewhat
of strength and elasticity, and we hoped against hope.
She married soon after graduating, and moved to the
South. When the war opened, she and her husband
were obliged to flee; hunted from county to county and
from State to State, they at last crossed the Ohio. No
sooner had her feet touched her native soil, than, turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
to him who was her all, she said&mdash;Go. She lived to see
the war closed; but the watching and the waiting had
been too much for her. The old family enemy claimed
its victim.</p>

<p>The fifth, in reply to the question, &ldquo;What are you
doing?&rdquo; answers: &ldquo;Bringing up my boys. When my
husband is away, besides attending to home duties, I
have charge of his business, receiving and paying out
large sums of money.&rdquo; She might have added, as I
know, that she was general city missionary without pay;
that, when there was no man to fill the place, she was
Sabbath-school Superintendent, church organist, or
leader of the choir, and that many a poor girl had had
her sentence in the police court lightened through her
timely intervention. I need not say that she is not an
invalid.</p>

<p>The sixth, a dignified wife and mother, I have not
seen for three years. At that time she entered no complaint
of poor health.</p>

<p>The seventh has been constantly employed in teaching.
Once during the seventeen years the state of her
health demanded a lengthening of the ordinary vacation.
She gave herself to out-door exercise, and, when able to
walk ten miles with perfect ease, she returned to the
school-room. She reports herself to-day as well, and
offers as proof, that during the last year she has not lost
a single recitation from ill-health.</p>

<p>The eighth I have heard from, from time to time;
first, as a successful teacher, then as a successful housewife,
never as an invalid.</p>

<p>The tenth was for many years a most earnest teacher.
It is over a year since I heard from her. She was then
well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>The eleventh is Preceptress of the Normal School at
Ypsilanti, Michigan. She is known throughout the
State as one of its successful educators. I heard her
read last week a most interesting paper, before the
State Teachers' Association. She looks as if continuous
education and continuous teaching had both been good
for her. When asked what she thought of Dr. Clarke's
book she laughingly answered, &ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The twelfth answers from Illinois: &ldquo;I am in good
health, and so are my six boys. The two oldest are
almost ready for college. They will, of course, go
where their mother went. I am daily thankful I studied
at Oberlin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away from the plains of Kansas comes the cheering
words of the thirteenth: &ldquo;A troop of merry children;
good health, and a happy home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fourteenth writes: &ldquo;Why do you ask if I am
sorry that I studied at Oberlin? It is the subject over
which my husband and I can grow enthusiastic at any
time. My health impaired there? <i>No.</i> We hope to
send our daughter soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fifteenth we have not heard from for some time.
We only know that as a minister's wife her life has not
been an idle one. Ten years after graduating she was
in ordinary health.</p>

<p>The sixteenth. Again we hear no response. &ldquo;In
Memoriam&rdquo; is written over her grave.</p>

<p>The seventeenth lives in Mississippi. She was well
when visited by some of our Union boys during the war.
I have no later report to give.</p>

<p>The eighteenth certainly does not count herself an
invalid; and</p>

<p>The nineteenth, who was, as a school-girl, the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
personation of energy, looks forward to years of useful
labor.</p>

<p>We are told that we must not look at the blooming
class on graduation day for the effects of co-education.
We have not. We have waited seventeen years.
Have we found anything there to frighten even a
physiologist?</p>

<p>The theory of Oberlin has never been identical co-education,
except in the class-room. There &ldquo;boys and
girls are taught the same things, at the same time, in the
same place, by the same faculty, with the same methods,
and under the same regimen.&rdquo; But she has never held,
practically or theoretically, &ldquo;that boys and girls are one,
and that the boys make the one,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;boys' and girls'
schools are one, and that that one is the boys' school.&rdquo; In
all those general regulations which affect both sexes, she
remembers that half her children are girls: and the modifications
which have consequently been made in ordinary
college rules and customs, are found to be just as good for
boys, and often a positive advantage. No early bell calls to
chapel prayers, but, when the recitations are over, all assemble
for devotional exercises. There is no standing during
these exercises, and the result is quiet, and an addition
both to &ldquo;the stock of piety,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the stock of health.&rdquo;
Oberlin furnishes no pleasanter sight than this daily
assembling of its thousand students for evening prayers.</p>

<p>Even in her architecture, simple and unpretending as
it is, there is a recognition of the fact that girls are not
boys. With one exception, there are no recitation rooms
on the second floor; and, while the dormitories for boys
are four stories high, Ladies' Hall has but two flights of
stairs.</p>

<p>There is no effort made to excite an unhealthful emu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>lation.
Prizes are never offered, and ranking of classes
is unknown. A record is kept by each teacher, of the
daily recitations in his department. If the average of
any student is found to be unsatisfactory, he is informed
of the fact, and an opportunity given him either to prepare
for a private examination, or quietly to withdraw
from his class.</p>

<p>The Women's and Men's Departments are entirely
distinct, the one being under the supervision of the
Faculty, the other of the Ladies' Board. This Board of
Managers is at present composed of nine ladies, who
live in Oberlin, and, with the exception of the lady
Principal, are none of them teachers in the college. To
them the trustees of the institution have confided all
questions touching the discipline, health, and general
welfare of the girls. In doing this, they were, no doubt,
actuated by the common-sense view, that women know
best what women need, and that, therefore, a Board of
Managers composed of experienced women and mothers
would frame wiser laws for the government of girls than
young tutors, or even gray-haired professors, with the
best of intentions, could possibly enact.</p>

<p>To the women who have composed this Board, especially
to those who were members during the early days
of persecution, much of the success which has attended
the experiment of co-education at Oberlin is due. The
President of the Board, Mrs. M. P. Dascomb, has been
identified with the interests of the institution almost
from its founding, and was for seventeen years Principal
of the Ladies' Department. A sketch of her life may
be found in <i>Lives of Eminent Women</i>. But an impress
of her life is left not only in the characters of the
620 women who have graduated, but in the thousands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
who have studied for a limited time at Oberlin. She is
to-day as energetic, as enthusiastic, as untiring in her
devotion to sound education as when we first knew her
twenty-two years ago. Her elastic step has yet promise
in it. Her cheerful outlook upon life has the quickening
influence of a June sunshine after a May shower.
Many in that last day will rise up and call her blessed.</p>

<p>It will be seen, from what has been said, that Oberlin,
outside the recitation-room, has two distinct codes of
rules, one for the girls and one for the boys. They
differ widely. Boys are prohibited from smoking and
drinking&mdash;no such restrictions are placed upon the girls.
Experience has shown that late study-hours are injurious
to the health of girls&mdash;and we have never seen it stated
that they were good for boys&mdash;consequently, girls are
required to retire at ten o'clock. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says some
one, with finger upraised, &ldquo;if boys can study more hours
than girls, they must accomplish more work, and have
better lessons; then the boys are wronged by making
them recite with the girls.&rdquo; In answer, we say, the
simple fact is that they do not have better lessons; and,
in proof, we ask any one to examine the class-books of
Oberlin for the last ten years. There are as many available
hours for study between sunrise and 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> as any
one, boy or girl, can use to advantage.</p>

<p>In the Ladies' Hall there is an experienced nurse, whose
duty it is not only to care for the sick, but to look after
the general health of all. Special instruction upon
various subjects is given the girls in the form of weekly
lectures, or familiar talks, in which health, and how it
may be preserved, is a leading topic.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke, in great perplexity, asks doubtfully &ldquo;if
there might not be appropriate co-education?&rdquo; We an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>swer
that there has been, for forty years at Oberlin.
Not in just the sense, perhaps, in which he uses the
term; not in so appropriate a way as it might have
been, or, we hope, will yet be, when an improved condition
of her treasury shall enable her trustees to carry out
their wisely-perfected plans. But, notwithstanding the
mistakes of inexperience, and the restrictions of poverty,
the result has been, on the whole, satisfactory&mdash;at least,
those who have tried it do not hesitate, in after years, to
send back their own children.</p>

<p>No &ldquo;inherent difficulty in adjusting, in the same institution,
the methods of instruction to the physiological
needs of each sex&rdquo; has been found. It should not be
overlooked, that there is a large Preparatory Department,
composed of hundreds of boys and girls, in connection
with the college, so that the experiment at Oberlin has
not included a small number. Last year there were in
the various departments 1,371 students, 648 of whom
were girls.</p>

<p>The excuse of sickness for an absence is never questioned.
This is well-known by every girl in the school;
and yet we have never heard a Professor in the College,
or a teacher in the Preparatory Department complain
that girls were oftener absent than boys. The Professor
in Physiology has kindly sent me the following:&mdash;&ldquo;An
examination of my class-book, in all my recitations for
the last five years, shows but a very slight difference in
the average number of absences from recitations, for
all causes, excused and unexcused, of women and men,
viz.:&mdash;for each man, 35.31, for each woman, 36.76.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is another fact which ought to be mentioned.
Many of the girls who have completed a course of study
at Oberlin have, at the same time, supported themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
This they have done mostly by teaching, which has left
them little time for rest or recreation even during the
short vacations.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Of course this would have been impossible,
if the expenses here were as great as in our
eastern colleges; but reduce them to the lowest minimum,
and, at the present rate of women's wages, the
meeting of these expenses in addition to regular college-work
is no slight consideration. Is it any wonder if
some who might endure the one, fail under the weight
of both? Several years ago, some benevolent Quaker
ladies of Philadelphia gave a few hundred dollars for the
benefit of this class of girls, and within the last few
months others have added to the sum. It is now
proposed to secure a permanent fund of $10,000, the interest
to be used in helping those who are helping themselves.</p>

<p>Noticing one other point, we are done. There is an
intimation by our author, that boys educated in schools
like Oberlin become effeminate, and girls masculine.</p>

<p>If such men as our United States Geologist, whose enthusiastic
devotion to science has led to the exploring of
the head-waters of the Yellowstone, and the opening
with its rich treasures of the great Northwest&mdash;and if
our representative in Congress, who voted against the
salary bill and the retroactive clause, are specimens of
effeminate men, the country can endure more of them.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Bradley, who years ago went to Siam, and, besides
her numerous public duties as a missionary, has
found time to carry on the education of her own children,
sending back her sons, one of them, at least, fully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
fitted for college, and, now that her husband has been
taken from her by death, still hopefully continues in
the work&mdash;if Mrs. Cotting, who has so recently taught
all Turkey that a rich nabob cannot force even a poor
girl into an unwilling marriage; and that, in that country
of harems, a woman has rights which the government is
bound to respect&mdash;are masculine women, the world&mdash;humanity
says, Give us more such women.</p>

<p>We have presented these statements not because we
have any desire to enter into a controversy, but because
we believe they are facts which thinking parents and
teachers will be glad to know. If they have any bearing
whatever upon this question, they go far towards proving
that women are able physically, as well as intellectually,
to meet the demands of any well-regulated college.</p>

<h2>VASSAR COLLEGE.</h2>

<p>Inquiries regarding the health of Vassar students, particularly
as to &ldquo;whether it improves or degenerates
under the stimulus of regular and continued brain-work,&rdquo;
and regarding the sanitary regulations of the college, are
inquiries of interest and importance to every one who is
thinking&mdash;and who is not&mdash;about improved methods
of education for women.</p>

<p>The pronounced and very advanced position that
Matthew Vassar, the Founder, took, in relation to what
he considered a vital necessity in true education, the
judicious combining of physical training with high intellectual
culture, and which he incorporated into his
scheme for giving &ldquo;a fair chance for the girls,&rdquo; was, in
itself, almost a challenge to all the world to ask these
questions, and to scan critically the replies to them which
the institution should make, as years should go on, and
give adequate opportunity for the testing of the founder's
theories.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Mr. Vassar provided especial
advantages for the thorough establishment and maintenance
of a system of physical training. He placed the
great building that was to be the college home of many
women in the middle of a farm of two hundred acres,
lying upon a beautiful plateau, so that pure air, unobstructed
sunshine, good sewerage, an abundant water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
supply, quiet, freedom from intrusive observation in out-door
sports or employments, and varied encouragements
for active and healthful recreation, were all made possible.
He was careful that the provision for the heating
and lighting of the building should be generous, and
that there should be no lack in the arrangements for the
supply of suitable and well-prepared food. He built a
commodious gymnasium and riding-school, and experienced
instructors were put in charge of both those departments
of physical culture; and, agreeably to his
views and plan, one of the instituted professorships was
that of Physiology and Hygiene, whose incumbent was
also appointed resident physician, and given general
supervision of the sanitary arrangements of the household.</p>

<p>This brief sketch gives the prominent features of the
plan by which the founder and his associated trustees
and faculty hoped to solve the problem of providing for
the liberal education of women, and at the same time
promoting their healthy, vigorous and graceful physical
development. The following extract from President
Raymond's Report to the United States Commissioner
of Education at the Vienna Exposition, on &ldquo;Vassar College;
its Foundation, Aims, etc.,&rdquo; shows what creed
underlayed the arduous labor which the solution of this
problem involved: &ldquo;Recognizing the possession by
woman of the same intellectual constitution as man's,
they claimed for her an equal right to intellectual culture,
and a system of development and discipline based
on the same fundamental principles. They denied that
any amount of intellectual training, if properly conducted,
could be prejudicial, in either sex, to physical health
or to the moral and social virtues. They believed, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
light of all experience, that the larger the stock of
knowledge and the more thorough the mental discipline
a woman actually attains, other things being equal, the
better she is fitted to fill every womanly position, and
to perform every womanly duty, at home and in society.
At the same time, they could not but see that there are
specialties in the feminine constitution, and in the functions
allotted to woman in life, and they believed that
these should not be lost sight of in arranging the details
of her education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To give an idea of some of the complications and
perplexities which beset the infancy of this educational
enterprise, I cannot do better than to quote at length
from President Raymond's Report above named. I
think that his testimony, which is that of an experienced
and observing teacher, is of great value, especially upon
the point of the ruinous lack of system that has so
generally obtained in the education of girls:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In September, 1865, the institution was opened for
the reception of students. A large number, between
the ages of fifteen and twenty-four, from all parts of the
Union and from Canada, applied for examination, and
about three hundred and fifty were accepted. A respectable
minority of these, say one-fourth or one-third, had
been well taught&mdash;a few admirably. But of the great
majority, it could not be said with truth that they were
thoroughly grounded in anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the ordinary English branches, had the same
tests been applied then that are applied now, one-half the
candidates would have been refused. In these branches
the advantage was notably with those who had been
taught in the graded public schools, particularly of the
larger towns and cities; and none appeared to less advantage
than those on whom the greatest expense had
been lavished in governesses and special forms of home
or foreign education.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In the more advanced studies, the examinations revealed
a prevailing want of method and order, and much
of that superficiality which must necessarily result from
taking up such studies without disciplinary preparation.
Such preparation seemed not to have been wholly neglected;
but in a majority of cases it had been quite insufficient,
and often little better than nominal. Most of
the older students, for instance, had professedly studied
Latin, and either algebra or geometry, or both. But the
Latin had usually been 'finished' with reading very
imperfectly a little C&aelig;sar and Virgil; and the algebra
and geometry, though perhaps in general better taught,
had not infrequently been studied in easy abridgments,
of little or no value for the purposes of higher scientific
education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing was made clear by these preliminary examinations:
that, if the condition of the higher female
education in the United States was fairly represented by
this company of young women, with a great deal that
was elevated in aim, and earnest in intention, it was
characterized by much confusion, much waste of power,
and much barrenness of result, and admitted of essential
improvement.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;An inquiry into their plans for future study revealed
as clearly their need of authoritative guidance and direction.
There was no lack of zeal for improvement.
Almost all had been drawn to the college by the hope
of obtaining a higher and completer education than
would be afforded them elsewhere. Indeed, the earnestness
of purpose, assiduity of application and intelligence
to appreciate good counsel, which have, from the beginning,
characterized the students as a body, are a noticeable
and encouraging fact. But their reliance at first was
largely on the adventitious advantages which the college
was supposed to possess for putting them in possession of
their favorite branches of knowledge and culture. Of the
real elements and processes of a higher education, and of
the subjective conditions of mental growth and training,
comparatively few, either of the students or their parents,
appeared to have any definite idea. There was no lack
of definiteness of choice. Tastes and inclinations were
usually positive; reasons were not so plentiful. That
the young lady 'liked' this study or 'disliked' that,
was the reason perhaps most frequently assigned. If its
force was not at once conceded, she strengthened it by
increased emphasis, declaring that she was 'passionately
fond' of the one and 'utterly detested' or 'never could
endure' the other. Practical studies were greatly in
vogue, especially with parents; 'practical' meaning
such as had an immediate relation, real or fancied, to
some utility of actual life, such, for example, as that of
chemistry to cooking, or of French to a tour in Europe.
Appropriateness for the discipline of the faculties, or the
equipment of the mind for scientific or philosophical investigation,
might not be appreciated as practical considerations
at all.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The deepest impression made by these preliminary examinations
on those who conducted them was this; that
the grand desideratum for the higher education of
women was <i>regulation</i>, authoritative and peremptory.
Granting that the college system for young men, coming
down from an age of narrow prescription and rigid uniformity,
needed expansion, relaxation, a wider variety of
studies and freer scope for individual choice, there was
evidently no such call in a college for women. In the
field of '<i>female education</i>,' without endowments, without
universities or other institutions of recognized authority,
without a history, or even a generally accepted
theory, there was really no established <i>system</i> at all; and
a system was, of all things, the thing most urgently demanded.
That it should be a perfect system was less
important than that it should be definite and fixed,
based upon intelligent and well-considered principles,
and adhered to, irrespective of the taste and fancies and
crude speculations of the students or their friends.
The young women who, all over the land, were urging
so importunate a claim for thorough intellectual culture
should first of all be taught what are the unalterable
conditions of a thorough culture, alike for women and
for men, and should be held to those conditions, just as
young men are held, whether they 'like' the discipline
or not. The rising interest in the subject of woman's
education, which so signally marked the recent progress
of public sentiment, required a channel through which it
might be directed to positive results. If Vassar College
had a mission, was it not, clearly, to contribute something
to that consummation?</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the task, therefore, of reducing to order the heterogeneous
medley before them, the Faculty set themselves
with all earnestness. Many have wondered why there
should have been any delay in doing this&mdash;why a collegiate
course was not at once marked out and the students
forthwith formed into corresponding classes. The
reason will appear on a moment's reflection. It is easy
to build a college on paper. To produce the real thing
requires a variety of material, prepared and shaped for
the purpose. There must not only be buildings and apparatus,
books and learned professors, but there must be
<i>students</i>&mdash;students who have passed through a preparatory
process which requires not only time, but certain
moulding influences of a very definite character; and it
will not be found easy&mdash;at least, it was not found easy
eight years ago&mdash;to get together four hundred young
women, or one-fourth of that number, so prepared.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;One fact, however, the Faculty discovered, which
went far to counterbalance all their discouragements. It
was this: the most mature, thoughtful, and influential of
the students perfectly apprehended the situation, knew
what they needed, and earnestly sought it. They were
really in advance of the men of years and experience,
with whom the decision rested. With the quick insight
of intelligent women&mdash;or, rather, with that exact discernment
wherewith the sufferer of an evil takes its measure,
fixes its locality, and presages its remedy&mdash;they had
worked out the solution of the problem; and they
watched with the deepest solicitude the settlement of
the question, what the institution was to be. Modestly,
but firmly, earnestly, and intelligently, they pleaded
for the adoption of the highest educational standard,
avowed their readiness to submit themselves to the
most rigid conditions, and exerted a powerful influence
to diffuse right views among the more intelligent of
their fellow-students. It soon became evident that here
was the vital nucleus for the future college; and around
that nucleus the elements gathered with decisive rapidity.
Before the close of the year, the Faculty found themselves
supported in their desire for a full and strict collegiate
course by a strong current of sentiment among the
students themselves. The brains of the institution were
enlisted on that side; and it was manifest that hence-forth
the best class of students would be satisfied with
nothing less. The <i>controversy</i> was at an end. What
remained was to make the idea a reality.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;But it was not until the close of its third year that the
institution fully attained a collegiate character. During
these three years the Faculty had been carefully studying
the conditions of the problem before them, ascertaining
through an extensive intercourse with students, parents,
intelligent educators, and through other channels of
information, the nature of the public demand, and gradually
maturing a permanent course of study to meet as
far as practicable its conflicting elements.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The lack of method and discipline that characterized
the mental habits of the assembly of young women who
gathered here, was even more evident in their physical
habits, and the effort to counteract the results of injudicious
food, dress, social excitement, etc., seemed for a
time almost hopeless. But, as order began to be evolved
from the original chaos of the educational elements, a
corresponding improvement was seen in the hygienic
<i>morale</i>; and year by year this has made steady advance,
keeping pace with the constantly improved standard of
scholastic attainment.</p>

<p>Those who have had large experience as teachers will
readily understand how the disappointment and irritation
that so many of these students felt, both as to their mistaken
notions regarding their previous education, and
their vague and irrational ideas about what they would
accomplish in a brief residence at this new Woman's
College, acted unfavorably upon their health. In not a
few instances there was induced an abnormal sensitiveness,
which made it well-nigh, sometimes entirely, impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
for them to remain in such a large household. This,
added to the usual homesickness of young people making
their first essay in independent living, and the absence
of regular and definite duties, made a peculiarly
trying ordeal for the first few months. Then, all the
while and everywhere, beside and beyond these general
disturbing influences, there were found the special and
individual lack of any sound hygienic theory and practice,
and a persistent antagonism to the sanitary regulations
which were made obligatory. That the time for
sleep should begin early, and be uninterrupted for eight
hours, was a rule stoutly resisted and habitually disobeyed
by many a pale-faced, nervous girl, who, when remonstrated
with, had invariably at her tongue's end. &ldquo;At
home I have always studied as late at night and as early
in the morning as I pleased, and it never hurt me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Numbers of little, stunted, dyspeptic girls &ldquo;couldn't
see any sense in making such a fuss if they didn't go
regularly to meals;&rdquo; these it was not easy to convince
that no good brain-work could be done on a diet of toast
and tea, or crackers soaked in a paste of vinegar, molasses,
mustard, pepper and salt, or confectionery and pastry.
They &ldquo;hated&rdquo; beef and vegetables, and brown bread,
as well as stated hours for partaking of such simple rations.</p>

<p>Those who came here with suitable clothing could have
been counted on one's fingers. The gospel of good apparel
according to Miss Phelps and Mrs. Woolson had
not then been preached; and, although the testimony of
plain, every-day doctors, and of learned medical professors
was that they had labored earnestly for many years
to persuade women to wear flannel underclothing and
thick-soled shoes, Fashion's frown had deterred the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
mothers from accepting the advice, so what could be expected
from the daughters but a following of the same
customs, and an increased tendency to rheumatism, neuralgia,
congestions, and other besetments of low vital
force?</p>

<p>These statements give a glimpse of the work which
came to the resident physician in this houseful of young
people, and also of some or the obstacles that prevented
the early establishment of a satisfactory regimen. But
progress was all the while making in the right direction,
though there were many failures and discouragements;
and, best of all, there was the same nucleus that President
Raymond speaks of, viz., a group of intelligent,
conscientious students, who, once having learned physiological
truths, accepted them as guides in daily living;
and from this group emanated an influence that was felt,
to a greater or less degree, by even the youngest and
most frivolous.</p>

<p>Gradually it became disgraceful to have hysterics, or to
give other marked evidence of a want of self-control: a
good appetite that was regularly appeased by plain, nutritious
food came to be regarded, first, as not unladylike;
second, as quite proper; and last, as a desired blessing:
thin walking shoes, insufficient clothing, squeezed-up
waists, and the like, grew in disfavor till they were
stamped &ldquo;vulgar,&rdquo; and the careful gymnastic drill, with
its appropriate light, warm, loose dress, taught to many
their first lesson of physical freedom.</p>

<p>To Elizabeth M. Powell (now Mrs. Henry Bond, of
Florence, Mass.), who was the first Instructor in Physical
Training after the gymnasium was built, and who for
five years pursued her admirable method with more and
more success, the college is greatly indebted for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
thorough respect which that department has always commanded,
and for its harmonious co-operation in the primary
business of these students in science and literature.</p>

<p>Just as the courses of study became more definite in
aim and requirement, as the work of each class was more
clearly marked out and adhered to, and as the intellectual
life responded to the impulse of a reasonable and
steady demand, so was the physical life strengthened.
By the close of the third year we could not but be as
much encouraged by the advance of hygienic sentiment
and practice among the students, as we were by their
commendable progress in liberal culture; and both
seemed to us largely and fairly attributable to the systematic
methods which, one by one, had been patiently
wrought out from the original confusion, and as patiently
fitted into an efficient working-plan.</p>

<p>So far as I am able to judge, no one thing here has
done more to counteract the hereditary or acquired tendency
of many young women, to disorders peculiar to
their age and sex than the opportunity for pursuing,
quietly and continuously, with a definite aim and certain
purpose, well-arranged courses of study.</p>

<p>I can recall numbers of instances of girls who came to
us weak, indifferent, listless, full of morbid whims and uncontrolled
caprices of mind and body, who gained in this
bracing atmosphere of happy, sustained industry, such
an impetus toward real health that they forgot aches and
discontents, and went home ready and eager to do their
share in the world's work.</p>

<p>Every one knows that uncongenial, badly-planned,
disconnected, or purposeless effort fatigues, worries, and
weakens both body and mind: is it difficult to believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
the converse&mdash;that thorough, methodical, and helpful
activity stimulates and strengthens.</p>

<p>To these general statements, I add the following particulars
respecting the last three classes. I have divided
each class into three groups, designated respectively
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Delicate,&rdquo; according to the condition
of health in which the individual students entered upon
the college curriculum.</p>

<center>CLASS OF 1871.</center>
<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="1871">

<p>Of the fourteen &ldquo;good,&rdquo; thirteen graduated in as good
health; one in much deteriorated health.</p>

<p>Of the five &ldquo;fair,&rdquo; all left improved, as did also the
&ldquo;two delicate.&rdquo;</p>

<center>CLASS OF 1872.</center>
<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="1872">

</table></div>

<p>Of the eighteen &ldquo;good,&rdquo; all left in as good or better
health.</p>

<p>Of the nine &ldquo;fair&rdquo; all improved, and the one &ldquo;delicate&rdquo;
had ceased to make that distinction necessary;
she was promoted to &ldquo;fair.&rdquo;</p>

<center>CLASS OF 1873.</center>
<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="1873">
<tr><td align='left'>Entered</td><td align='left'>in</td><td align='left'>good</td><td align='left'>health</td><td align='right'>19</td></tr>

<tr><td align='center'>"</td><td align='center'>"</td><td align='left'>delicate</td><td align='center'>"</td><td align='right'>12</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Of the nineteen &ldquo;good,&rdquo; fifteen left as well as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
came. Two took the course too young, and felt the
undue strain in diminished general strength. Two deteriorated
in health.</p>

<p>Of the fourteen &ldquo;fair,&rdquo; five left in essentially the same
condition; nine improved.</p>

<p>Of the twelve &ldquo;delicate,&rdquo; five left in the same condition;
seven improved.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that every year the same
old battles with bad habits in dress, diet, exercise, sleep,
and work, have to be fought; but the enemies are not so
numerous, and the allies of health and common sense are
always gaining in numbers and strength; so the prospect
for ultimate and complete victory improves. Perhaps
the greatest obstacle that we find to the consummation of
our scheme for intellectual training, is the pressure made
by students, and even more strongly by their parents, to
take the work while they are too young.</p>

<p>Fifteen is the minimum age at which any are admitted,
even for the preparatory classes; but no girl of fifteen
has the poise, the <i>settledness</i> of nerve and muscle
and brain to enable her to bear uninjured the immense
strain that the mere living in such a great family necessitates.
It is almost impossible for any one who has not
tried it to understand this; and parents listen with a polite,
incredulous smile, when I explain why I think it
unwise for their bright young daughters to attempt here
the not difficult Latin, mathematics, etc., of the preparatory
years. We&mdash;the parents and I&mdash;agree perfectly
that the girls can do the work easily enough, but they,
the parents, can not see the difference which is so clear to
my mind&mdash;as, after these eight years, it could hardly
help being&mdash;the difference that it will make to the
girls whether they do the work in the small classes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the home school, and surrounded in their leisure hours
with the freedom and repose of the accustomed family,
or in the large classes that are here necessary, and amid
the inevitable excitements, outside the recitation room,
of a constant residence in a household of five hundred.</p>

<p>Again and again I have seen these young students, for,
of course, they enter despite my protestations&mdash;everybody
wants to see the folly of everything for himself&mdash;I have
seen them succumb to the unwonted nervous tax within
a few weeks; others bear up for months, many get
through the year and go home to spend their summer
vacation in bed&mdash;&ldquo;Vassar victims&rdquo; all, whose ghosts
haunt the clinical records of doctors from Texas to Canada,
from Maine to California, and whose influence
makes, so far as it is felt, against woman's chances for
liberal education; for these failures are counted as natural
effects of study, of mental labor which the female organization
cannot endure!</p>

<p>I have no doubt that, for a respectable minority of
these fifteen-year-old girls, life here, with its absolute
regularity of hygienic regimen, is less disadvantageous
than the mixture of school and &ldquo;society,&rdquo; in which
they would be permitted to dissipate their energies at
home; but that does not alter the fact that the vital
needs of immaturity, physical, mental, and moral; cannot
be most wholesomely met amid conditions so artificial
as must obtain in a great educational establishment.</p>

<p>With those who enter more advanced classes at an
immature age&mdash;fortunately, they are very few&mdash;the case
is still worse, for, in addition to the nervous tax to which
I have alluded above, they attempt woman's work with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
a child's strength. The result is inevitable&mdash;a stunted,
unsatisfactory womanhood, the penalty for the violating
of Nature's law of slow, symmetrical development, is not
to be escaped.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke's <i>Sex in Education</i> puts this point well,
and perhaps the little book may be forgiven its coarseness
and bad logic, if it succeeds in awakening the consciences
of parents and teachers with regard to this
phase of the school question, a phase which bears with
equal pertinency upon a fair chance for boys and for
girls.</p>

<p>When women begin at eighteen or twenty the earnest
business of a collegiate course, for which they have slowly
and thoroughly prepared while their physical organization
was maturing in happy freedom, and when they
give to this higher intellectual labor the strength and
enthusiasm that are at that age of all the life pre&euml;minent
and most perfectly balanced, then we shall know what
educated woman is, and learn her possible capacities in
all that makes for the noblest humanity.</p>

<p>I do not undervalue what Oberlin, Antioch, Mt. Holyoke,
and other schools have accomplished for woman's
higher education. I would not willingly be ranked
second to any in according to them the esteem and honor
which their work richly merits; and among Vassar's own
Alumn&aelig; are already many who give gracious promise of
what may be hoped for, nay, fulfilled, when the good
seed now sowing all over this broad land shall come to
glad fruition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Vassar is doing what she can to promote
the health and usefulness of American women, by giving
to her students the wholesome stimulus of regular,
organized activity, which has for its definite aim their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
preparation for the serious duties of life&mdash;duties which
trained faculties carry with steady poise, growing strong
under the burden, but which press with sad and crushing
weight upon unaccustomed powers.</p>

<h2>LETTER FROM A GERMAN WOMAN.</h2>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">February</span> 6, 1874.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Brackett</span>:</p>

<p>I gladly comply with your request to give you such
information as I possess concerning the education of
young girls in Germany. What I have to say is, however,
more particularly applicable to the southern portions
of that country.</p>

<p>Girls generally attend the public school from the age
of six or seven to eleven, where they occupy themselves
with the more elementary branches; afterwards they are
placed in a seminary or &ldquo;Institut,&rdquo; in which they remain
until sixteen or eighteen. The German girl of that age,
if not a member of the titled aristocracy, is seldom
taught at home, except in music, and perhaps in drawing;
private instruction being indeed too expensive even
for the best families; neither is she sent to a boarding-school,
if a moderately good day-school is at all accessible.</p>

<p>In my school days neither Latin nor Greek were
taught, and only the elementary branches of science;
from reliable sources I hear that the present curriculum
is nearly the same. But in all schools the girls were
thoroughly drilled in German, French, Rhetoric, Composition,
Arithmetic, History, and in the History of
Literature. English and Italian were optional. The
hours extended from nine till twelve, and from two to
four or five, no other intermission being allowed&mdash;which
seemed often rather hard. One and frequently two
hours were spent in needlework, which time was utilized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
in the practice of French and English conversation with
an experienced teacher. The girls prepared their lessons
at home, and recited sitting. Their attendance was
expected to be <i>uninterrupted</i>, and was usually so, even
through the critical period of development, except in
cases of suffering and trouble, and these were not frequent.
I remember but little complaint of headache and
weariness&mdash;back-ache seemed unknown. And yet these
girls worked hard, many of them very hard. Some began
to teach when only sixteen, or even younger, and
while still pursuing their own studies. They went out
generally in every weather, and at all times, month in
and month out.</p>

<p>Now, why did they not break down? Why do we find
comparatively few invalids among the educated German
girls and women? Are there no other causes at work than
a somewhat different climate and, occasionally, a more
phlegmatic temperament; or is it because the studies of
the modern languages and history, the endless practising
of <i>&eacute;tudes</i> and sonatas, the stooping wearily over some
delicate embroidery, is less taxing to the nervous system
than Latin and Greek, and the working out of algebraic
problems? I am not prepared to say. But grant that a
small part of the solution can be found in this difference,
there are yet other and deeper causes at work. One of
them is that the young German girl, while at school,
makes study her sole business. She goes to no parties,
visits no balls. She does not waste her hours of sleep or
leisure in putting numberless ruffles on her garments, so
as to surpass her mother in elegance, nor does she promenade
up and down the avenues and flirt with young
gentlemen. Her amusements are of the simplest. A
walk, or an hour spent in a public garden in her mother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
company; occasionally a concert or an opera, which never
lasts later than nine or half-past nine; some holiday afternoon,
a little gathering of young school-friends, to which
gentlemen are not admitted; once or twice a year, perhaps,
after she is fifteen, private theatricals or a <i>soir&eacute;e</i>;
where she appears in a simple dress, dances under her
mother's care, and returns home at eleven o'clock. In
this way she manages her strength and husbands her
forces for study.</p>

<p>Another cause of her better health is the great physical
care taken at the critical periods of the month;
although, as I have previously said, she continues her
studies during these days, if without suffering; I must
add, that on the other hand she abstains from all physical
exercise like gymnastics or dancing-lessons, protects
herself most carefully against cold and wet, sleeps perhaps
a little longer in the morning, and instead of taking
a walk, lies down for an hour through the day. A party
or ball at such a time would be looked upon by the
mother with horror, and considered by the girl herself
as a great impropriety. The care of her health is at all
times, of importance to German women. I have, for
instance, very rarely seen them walk in bitter-cold winter
weather in a so-called cloak, which left the abdomen
entirely unprotected.</p>

<p>A third cause of the German girl's being better able
to work with impunity than her American sister during
the years of development, which in South Germany begin
at the age of fourteen, may be found in the simpler
and much more sensible way in which she is brought up
while still in early childhood. A German mother does
not bedeck her little daughter of four or eight years with
flounces and sashes half as heavy as herself, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
show her off in a parlor full of admiring friends; nor
send her to a children's ball, where, with a young prodigy
of the other sex, she imitates her elders in flirtation.
Instead of coaxing the wilful darling into obedience by
the promise of candy, utterly disregardful of future
dyspepsia, she brings her to reason by more efficient, if
less agreeable expedients. The child is encouraged to
play with her dolls, and to find pleasure in flowers and
child-like amusements, as long as possible. Thus she
grows up with simple tastes, although a little awkward
and shy.</p>

<p>And, on the other hand, the mother herself finds her
chief pleasure at home, and does not dream of planning
amusements for each night of the week, but keeps comparatively
early hours, even in the city; takes a great
deal of exercise in the open air, and thus remains generally
strong and healthy after her nursery is well filled.</p>

<p>Now I do not say that the German education comes
up to the ideal. Far from it, indeed! The German
girl might, with profit, go more deeply into the wonderful
mysteries of science, just as her American sister is
supposed to do; counterbalance her somewhat too poetical
tendencies by the severer pursuit of mathematics,
and find delight in the beauties of Latin and Greek
authors, if such should be her sincere desire. Nor can
I see any objection to the pursuit of medical, and other
higher intellectual studies, by the few whose enthusiasm
and natural gifts fit them for it.</p>

<p>All this the German woman will safely accomplish, if
she retains the simplicity of her manners and tastes, a
quiet, undisturbed mind during the years of early youth,
the while not forgetting to preserve the priceless gift of
health.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>That this desirable consummation will be better and
more safely reached by an adequate separate education,
which can take into account woman's peculiar physical
organization when necessary, rather than by co-education,
no one, I think, can predict. Thus far, the idea of
co-education has not penetrated the German brain, and
the German woman is too shy and modest to think of
downright, decided competition with man.</p>

<p>Whether the radical changes in education now progressing
in this country, and still in the future for Germany,
will yield valuable fruit, and conduce to better the
condition of women, it seems to me, experiment rather
than theory, must show.</p>

<p>I am with sincere respect, yours truly,</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ogden N. Rood</span>.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2><span class="smcap">Sex in Education.</span></h2>

<p>There has recently appeared a collection of essays on
the subject of girls' education, which, for the reason
that it has excited so much attention, cannot here be
passed by without special notice. It is seldom that any
book arouses so much criticism, and, withal, so much
earnest opposition as this has provoked, and seldom do
the newspapers so generously open their columns to
discussions so extended on the merits and demerits
of any publication. The author is a physician of high
repute in the city of Boston, Dr. E. H. Clarke. With
regard to the criticisms on it, the general observation
may be made, that where the writer is a man, praise is
more generally bestowed than in those cases where a
woman is the author, though there are very marked exceptions,
the bitterest criticism of a large number in my
possession being written by a man. Women, from
their stand-point of women, very generally unite in disagreeing
with its premises, and from their stand-point as
reasoning beings, they are unable to accept its conclusions,
the premises being granted. And these adverse
criticisms, these indignant protests, are not solely from
teachers, but also from mothers, from those who have
never taught, and the most candid and dispassionate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
one of all, from a woman in no wise connected with
schools, either public or private.</p>

<p>But even supposing that they were all from teachers,
does that fact, except under a very narrow view of
human nature, render them any the less valuable?
Does one profession blind the eyes more than the
other? Even in the narrowest view possible to the
teacher, is it not for her interest that her pupils should
be healthy? How can mental work be satisfactorily
done without physical vigor? If it be objected here
that some teachers are interested only in present results,
unmindful of future consequences, I enter a counter
statement that the same is true of some physicians, and
bar the line of argument which would compare the
poorest teachers with the best physicians.</p>

<p>The profession of teaching is not thus narrow in its
views; is not so led by present and temporary motives.
Its members are not working for glitter and show in
the few years of school life; they do not aim at showy
displays at the risk of permanent injury. They work
not for to-day, but for all time and for eternity. Their
greatest reward is in seeing the development of mind,
the correction of false habits, the strengthening grasp
of thought, and the growth of character. Are they
any less desirous than the physician that the delicate
instrument which puts the soul in communication
with the external world, and by means of which it
must be developed, be in perfect tune? Do they desire
any less earnestly than he, that they may assist in forming
from the effervescent girl-life of America a gracious
womanhood, fully able to bear any strain which active
life may bring, rejoicing to become in due time true
wives and real mothers? Is the future of American
women any less dear to the teaching profession than to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the medical profession? Do they &ldquo;care less for human
suffering and human life than the success of their
theories?&rdquo; Are not the teachers seeking truth as well
as the physicians? Are not they, to use the simile of
one able critic, also attentive at their watch-towers of
science and experience? A woman who has been teaching
for many years, and has been all the time associated
with large numbers of growing girls; who has been intimately
acquainted with their habits and their health;
has held their confidence, and has watched them carefully
day after day, not infrequently being called on
for direct medical advice as well&mdash;has had an opportunity
for acquiring a fund of practical knowledge on the subject
which is available to no man, even though he be
physician. It were well to be just. Let the teachers
have credit at least for intelligence and honesty as well
as the physicians.</p>

<p>Does any one assert that Dr. Clarke does not blame
the teachers? We answer, as we shall show more fully
in another place, that any reflection on what is known
in technical language as the school &ldquo;system&rdquo; of any
country, is a reflection on the teachers of those schools.
If any one doubts the power of the teachers as a body
to mould the internal arrangements and details of the
schools, the school records of more than one city will
furnish him with cases where the teachers have forced
upon the committee and the schools, measures by them
judged necessary, text-books of which they approved, and
their candidates for vacant places, till their power and
influence will appear no longer doubtful.</p>

<p>The book does not ostensibly on its title-page claim
to be a work on co-education, but none the less is that
the subject considered from first to last. In the preface,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
the author remarks in an apology for plainness of
speech: &ldquo;The nature of the subject which the Essay
discusses, the general misapprehension both of the strong
and weak points of the woman question, <i>and the ignorance
displayed by many, of what the co-education of
the sexes really means</i>, all forbid that ambiguity of language
or euphemism of expression should be employed
in the discussion.&rdquo; The italics are ours, but the words
are Dr. Clarke's; and unmistakably show that the main
drift of the book is to stem and if possible to turn the
tide of popular conviction which is opening our colleges,
new and old, to students, without regard to sex.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Again, the volume is divided into five parts, as follows,
to quote the table of contents:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 12em;"><ol type="I"><li>Introductory.</li>
<li>Chiefly Physiological.</li>
<li>Chiefly Clinical.</li>
<li>Co-Education.</li>
<li>The European Way.</li></ol></div>

<p>Part I. asserts that there is a difference between men
and women; accuses woman of neglecting the proper
care of her body; demands her physical development as a
woman&mdash;not forgetting, however, on page 24, to call
attention to co-education as a great and threatening
danger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>Part II. is, as it claims to be, physiological, and presents
nothing new to the student.</p>

<p>Part III. contains an account of seven exceptional
cases of diseased action which have come under the
writer's observation; a few more from another physician,
and ends with this sentence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The preceding physiological and pathological data
naturally <i>open the way to a consideration of the co-education
of the sexes</i>.&rdquo; The italics, as before, are ours.</p>

<p>Part IV. considers the subject of co-education, already
prejudged.</p>

<p>Part V. is merely of the nature of an appendix, which
attempts to show that in Europe the whole matter of
woman's health is carefully watched.</p>

<p>If the one object of the Essays is not to stay the
spread of co-education, we confess ourselves unable to
discover what it is. In this effort lies its only possible
unity, its <i>primum mobile</i>, its one clearly defined object
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The argument reduced, may be fairly stated thus:
Boys are capable of sustained and regular work; girls
are not so capable&mdash;therefore they cannot be educated
together (provided the standard is kept up to
the standard best for boys) without injuring the
girls.</p>

<p>Admit, then, for one moment, the premises, and grant
that our boys and girls are to have separate institutions
of learning. Every one sees, at one moment's reflection,
that it would be impracticable to take any account of the
occasional necessary absences from class recitation in the
general arrangements of our school, composed only of
girls. The programme must be arranged, even in that
case, for regular work, and each individual, must take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
her own time for absence, and must make up the class-work,
which, of course, must go on during her absence,
as best she may. The trouble still remains, unless, carrying
out Dr. Clarke's argument to its only logical conclusion,
we abolish class recitations entirely, and supply
each girl pupil with her own particular governess, who
can accommodate each day's work to the varying capacities
of her pupil and herself. I repeat, that this is the
only logical result possible, if we accept Dr. Clarke's
premises and conclusions. We shall find in France a
country where the girls have always been educated in
this way, or in convent schools. But shall we find in
France a country where the proportion of births to the
number of nubile women is greater than in our own?
And shall we find in France a country where the general
type of the race is degenerating or improving? It will
be replied that other causes are at work to produce the
result in France. The statement is granted; but have
we then sufficient grounds for asserting justly for America,
that &ldquo;to a large extent the present system of educating
girls is the cause of their pallor and weakness,&rdquo; or
that &ldquo;woman's neglect of her own organization, though
not the sole explanation and cause of her many weaknesses,
<i>more than any single cause</i>, adds to their number
and intensifies their power?&rdquo; (The italics are again
ours.)</p>

<p>We return to our statement, that the governess system
is the only system which can result as the logical outcome
of the book in question. But this, America is not
likely to accept. We ask, then, it being evident that in
any school the regular work must go on, though two or
three be absent, what difference it would make in the
practical result, whether the sixty or seventy present were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
all girls, or but half of them girls and half boys? Supposing
that the President of a university were told, on the
entrance of a student, that he would probably be absent
twenty or thirty days during the entire scholastic year,
and he were asked whether it would be possible for the
youth to perform satisfactorily the work of his class
under those conditions, does any one doubt what his
answer would be? So far on the practical side of the
question.</p>

<p>But when it is asserted that co-education is fatal to the
health of our women, more is implied than appears on
the surface; for, in reality, co-education and higher education
for women are almost synonymous terms. If, at
this moment, the gates of all the high schools and colleges
open alike to both sexes, were closed to the girls,
where, except at one honored institution, could they turn
to obtain a really thorough and all-sided education&mdash;such
an education as a young man would be satisfied with?
And who will assert that even Vassar College is to be,
for a moment, compared to Harvard and Yale in respect
to its facilities for acquiring a rounded education? One
may strike at co-education, and, at the same time, assert
that he demands for woman the highest development of
which she is capable&mdash;that he is only desirous of securing
to her &ldquo;a fair chance;&rdquo; and yet he cannot deny that he
deprives her of all chance, if his effort against co-education
should succeed.</p>

<p>As has been said, all criticisms on schools and school
systems are criticisms on the teachers, for it is they who
constitute and determine the school. If pupils are made
to stand during recitations, it is because the teachers of
the school desire it; but in a somewhat large daily
observation and intimate acquaintance with public schools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
of all grades, and in different sections of the Union,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> I
have yet to see any high or normal school, or, indeed,
any oldest class in a grammar school, in which the pupils
stand during recitation. In the lower grades they stand
or sit, as the teacher requires. I should say that in a
majority of cases they will be found standing, but, at
the same time, it should be borne in mind that in the
lower grades the recitations are much shorter, as a general
rule not exceeding ten or fifteen minutes. In the
older grades the pupil is almost universally expected to
rise to answer his question, and sit as soon as it is answered.
Leaving out the point of formal courtesy to
the teacher&mdash;a matter not to be lightly treated in its far
results on character&mdash;it is assumed, even in a physiological
point of view, that the momentary change of position is
better for bodies not yet matured than the constant sitting
posture.</p>

<p>I would not for one moment be understood as asserting
that much unreasonable work is not demanded of the
pupils in the public schools of the country, or as defending
the often excessive and unseasonable work. I most
emphatically record my protest against the custom of public
exhibitions, and the unnatural excitement which is
oftentimes kept up to stimulate the susceptible thought-machine
of the child and youth into abnormal activity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
But these evils are not inseparable from mixed schools,
nor do they belong exclusively to them. I have now in
mind a school of girls, directed by women exclusively,
where the girls have been for many days obliged to answer
in writing in ninety minutes, twenty difficult
questions, as an examination, three girls being allowed
only one copy of questions between them, and their promotion
to another class being dependent upon their success.
Two or three of these examinations are being
given in one session of five hours. But if the girls go
home from that school-work every day with cold hands
and feet, and a headache that keeps them on the sofa all
the afternoon, it is not because they are doing regular
work, nor are schools or systems in general to blame; the
only persons to blame are the individual teachers who plan
and carry out the barbarous and savage torture, and the
parents, who take so little notice of what is going on, that
they permit their daughters to continue such work. It is
not the legitimate brain-work, but the nervous excitement,
that breaks and kills. It is not work but worry that tires.</p>

<p>However, any words which lead to earnest discussion
on the educational question are welcomed by all true
educators, for Truth, which is the end and aim of their
search, will never suffer in the conflict.</p>

<p>But, were the &ldquo;old times&rdquo; so much better than the
present? In making the statement that they were, we
are always apt to be misled by omitting two considerations
of no light weight. The first is, that we draw
our information and statistics now from a vastly wider
area than in the &ldquo;good old times,&rdquo; and hence that our
figures relating to crime and disease always appear disproportionately
large. The railroad, the steamboat,
the telegraph, the printing-press&mdash;effects and causes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
advancing civilization&mdash;have practically enlarged our
mental horizon, and death, disease, and crime appear in
unnaturally large proportions. And yet, if it be true
that among the first Anglo-Saxon generation born and
reared on this side the Atlantic, it was common for the
men to have often, two, three, and four wives, it seems
that the causes of disease and death among the women
were not inactive even then.</p>

<p>The second consideration referred to is this: As medical
instruments multiply, diseases appear to multiply in
exact proportion. With the advent of the ophthalmoscope,
for instance, how innumerable and complicated
appear the diseases of the eye. Are we justified in concluding,
then, that in the &ldquo;good old times&rdquo; of our great-grandmothers&mdash;that
idyllic time when women must have
been at least free from the reproach that they, solely and
unaided, were destroying the hopes of the race&mdash;that
myopic, hypermetropic and astigmatic eyes were not in
existence? Such a conclusion would be manifestly
unfair. It seems impossible, in this view, to make any
fair comparison of the health of women in the present,
and in the past; that is, any comparison which will be
sufficiently accurate for scientific purposes.</p>

<p>It were better, if we must have an idyllic realm somewhere,
to posit it rather in the future than in the past,
and to work with all the light we are able to secure towards
its attainment. This working may, however, be
done in two ways as regards education: we may state,
first, and I think without fear of contradiction, that there
is too much sickness among American women. We may
then patiently and fully investigate all the habits of
those women, and if we come to the conclusion that co-education
or that over-study in amount or in manner is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the chief cause, we shall all give it up. We shall then
seek and find some better way of securing for our girls an
opportunity for the full development of every part of
their organization, venturing, however, to add 'brain'
to Dr. Clarke's list of &ldquo;muscle, ovary, stomach, and
nerve.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, we may assume in the first place the general
statement that co-education is not desirable&mdash;is objectionable&mdash;that
it must inevitably cause sickness if girls study
regularly every day; and conclude that regular study is
the chief cause of sickness among them.</p>

<p>And yet God is his own interpreter, and he will make
it plain at last, so that the man who runs may read, that
he is no such bungler in his workmanship as to fashion
the organism of a woman without giving her at the same
time the corresponding strength. We have too much
belief in him to believe that the power given to us is in
such niggardly measure for our needs; that, in order to
carry out perfectly the work of the organs most peculiarly
our own, the regular action of the brain must be
suspended. Not so. He who fits the shoulder to the
burden; who, in planning the complex organism, not only
made possible greatly increased size and strength whenever
they should be needed, but even took thought also
to provide for the return of the blood through capillary
and vein from the artery which has been severed by the
surgeon's knife, is not so forgetful of ends and means.
If extra work is to be done by the organism of the
woman, extra strength in exact proportion to the extra
effort has been provided,</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>To God, the brain of a woman is as precious as the
ovary and uterus, and as he did not make it impossible
for her to think clearly when the uterus is in a congested
state, so, reasoning analogically from the knowledge we
have of him, no more did he design that the uterus should
not be capable of healthy and normal action while the
brain is occupied with a regular amount of exercise.
Such is our creed.</p>

<p>We are more sure of Truth by the so-called deductive
than by the so-called inductive ladder, and it was not
without meaning that she was represented as dwelling at
the bottom of a well, for she is more surely reached by
descending to her abode from the so-called abstract, than
by climbing with our feet on the slippery concrete. Nay,
even though physical science still insists in words on
holding on to 'facts' and the testimony of the senses, forgetful
that any fact is after all only a &ldquo;relative synthesis,&rdquo;
we find it in its latest researches rapidly approaching
at both ends, things entirely out of the region of the
senses; for, beginning with invisible and intangible atoms,
which we are required to take on faith, and which are
assuredly very abstract, we find it passing to the correlation
of forces and modes of motion, which certainly
are as abstract as atoms.</p>

<p>Shall we not be quite as safe then in attempting to
solve the problem of &ldquo;woman's sphere, by applying to it
abstract principles of right and wrong,&rdquo; as by seeking
for it alone &ldquo;in Physiology?&rdquo; Woman is not merely a
&ldquo;cradle&rdquo; and a grave, as she is assumed to be in the essay
under consideration, and all attempts to settle the
question of her sphere by considering her as such, are
usually, and perhaps not unnaturally, found to excite indignation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>To apply the above statement: the women who are
urging to-day the question of education are often accused
of presenting education in the light of a quack medicine
which is warranted to cure all troubles. And it is true
that we do so present it, for the broader grows our experience
of men and women, and the more deeply and
widely we think, the more inevitably do we find this
problem of education appearing before us, in whatever
direction we turn. It is like the ducal palace in Carlsruhe,
to which all the main streets of the city converge,
and which meets one's eyes at every corner.</p>

<p>The question of woman's Dress, for instance, is never to
be solved by approaching it from the outside. Earnest
and vigorous writers may tell women what they ought to
do, and we all know perfectly well that if the skirts of our
dresses ended at the tops of our boots, and we were warmly
clad beneath in the full trousers proposed years ago by Mrs.
Bloomer, we could take much more exercise without fatigue,
and should be saved much time and much annoyance.
Who but a woman can appreciate the trouble of
always being obliged to use one hand in carrying her
skirts up long flights of stairs? Who but a woman
knows the inconvenience of her long skirts in entering or
leaving a carriage, or in a strong wind? Who but a
woman knows that it is utterly impossible to take even a
short walk on a rainy day, however well protected, without
bringing into the house an amount of wet clothing
which necessitates almost an entire change? And yet
there is not the slightest chance of securing the physiologically
needed reform by demonstrating these facts,
simply because, below all this question of dress, there lies
a deeper thing, of which dress is only the index&mdash;the
question of Sex, and the relations resulting from it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>For whose admiration and attraction do our young
women array themselves? To please whom do they
leave off their flannels and attend evening entertainments
in low-necked dresses, sweep the pavements with their
ornately trimmed skirts, and wear thin boots which shall
display to better advantage the well-turned foot? I desire
not to have it understood for one moment that I am
speaking lightly, or in terms of sweeping condemnation,
of the underlying consciousness, of which the external
dress is only an outward sign. The underlying impulse
is an inevitable, is a true, pure, and womanly one; on it
are based all institutions of civilization, for from it spring
marriage, the Family, Society, and the State, and an evil
tree cannot bring forth such fruit. It may, however, be
over-stimulated, and the extravagancies of dress and manner
which Broadway and Fifth Avenue, the opera, or any
fashionable assembly of young people display in America,
are universally and justly condemned by sober thought
as falling only a few grades behind actual immodesty.</p>

<p>But if we would produce any reform of any consequence
on the subject of external dress, we must do
it, not by attacking the dress at all; it will never be accomplished
in this way. So long as it is considered that
woman's chief and only duty, the only object of her creation,
in fact, is to minister to the comfort and happiness
of man; so long as it is represented to her that she fulfills
the ends of her being, only in the fact that she does
this; so long as it is not fully and freely allowed that a
woman owns herself, body and soul, in the same sense as
that in which a man owns himself&mdash;just so much and no
more&mdash;women will dress to please the taste of men, and
will vie with each other to excite their attention, and secure
their admiration. Teach a girl that her only des<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>tiny
is to be only any kind of a wife and a mother, to preserve
the race physically strong&mdash;keep this idea before her
daily, and the more thoroughly she is convinced of it, the
more conscientiously will she spend all her thought in
seeking and using the only means which are then likely
to help her to fulfill her so stated destiny.</p>

<p>But make her feel that she is a responsible being, accountable
only to God and her own rational judgment
for her actions; make her appreciate, as far as it is possible,
the responsibility devolving upon her as an individual,
as a member of society, as a citizen, as a reflection
of the Creator in his self-determining Intelligence; give
her such a mental training that she shall feel that she is
capable of taking her life in her own hand, and the
dress will take care of itself. I do not mean that she
will adopt the so-called Bloomer costume, but she will
let common sense, suitability, and a higher sense of
beauty, more than at present, regulate her garments.</p>

<p>In other words, if we would reform even so external
a matter as dress, we must ascend to the abstract principles
of ethics and metaphysics which Dr. Clarke so
lightly sets on one side; for all dress is only an index
of education, and all education, to be education at all,
must deduce every one of its principles at second hand
from ethics and metaphysics. Again, Huxley and
Agassiz may, as Dr. Clarke assumes (page 12), represent
physiology; but will &ldquo;Kant and Calvin, the Church
and the Pope&rdquo; all four of whom Dr. Clarke assumes to
be of no importance in settling the question&mdash;fairly represent
ethics and metaphysics? And yet, if we were
limited to these sources for these sciences of sciences,
perhaps we might as well return to Huxley and Agassiz,
and allow physiology to settle the question of woman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
sphere for us, on the ground that she is merely so many
material organs carefully contrived for only one special
purpose, and that, the perpetuation of the race.</p>

<p>Just here, before reviewers shall have an opportunity
for misinterpretation, may I pause to guard them against
it and to call their especial attention to the word &ldquo;<i>only</i>,&rdquo;
which has been so freely used above?</p>

<p>Why is it that the criticisms of so many women who
see below the surface, ring with a womanly indignation?
They are ready for rational argument, and for widely
collected and digested statistics. One of these justly
says in her criticism, that Dr. Clarke need not to have
written to Germany to be informed of the care which a
mother should exercise over the health of her daughter.
That there are mothers in America who do not take this
care, who are so occupied with other thoughts that they
have no time to attend to their children, we sadly know;
but some at least of us have had mothers who knew and
did their duty, and who handed down to us, unimpaired
the &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; which are well-known among women,
but of which men generally, even fathers of grown-up
daughters, have little knowledge, and some of them
none.</p>

<p>With regard to &ldquo;the European way,&rdquo; however, I subjoin
the following testimony from a German lady, now
a mother, in answer to inquiries. She says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was two years at school at Stuttgart, as a boarding
pupil, at the close of which I made my examination in
the highest class, No. 8, as it was called. When I
entered the school, there were twenty boarding pupils;
when I left, there were twenty-five; more than thirty were
never admitted. Day-scholars were about four hundred.
As to the regulations of the school concerning the pupils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
during the time to which you refer, <i>there was only one
general rule, that of being excused from the daily walk
which we took from one to two hours every day</i>. Only
two pupils during my stay at school were excused from
being present in their classes at that time, and this only
because the physician had so ordered it. They were not
kept in bed, but in the so-called sick-room, where they
could read, write, etc., and must only keep very quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This testimony, as showing the regulations in one of
the largest girls' schools in Germany, seems to me
valuable, as the course pursued by any large school is
the index of the public demand. As to the health of
English women, I copy the following paragraph from a
recently published book by an English woman,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which
would seem to indicate that women, at least in England,
are not so much superior to their American sisters:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women above actual want seldom suffer from extreme
labor or from excessive indulgence, but they
seldom enjoy their full vitality, either in exertion or in
pleasure. Whether from this reason or not, their most
frequent illnesses are those connected with deficient vitality,
such as can keep them in lingering misery for years;
affecting chiefly those organs whose activity is not immediately
necessary to life. Not half the illness of this kind is
under the care of a doctor. When he is consulted, it is,
if possible, at second-hand, and he is very likely to hear
only half the symptoms. * * * It is natural to point
to the multitude of women under constant medical care,
and the number of doctors whose practice lies chiefly
among female patients. But if those could be counted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
who are endeavoring to cure themselves by traditional
remedies, by quack medicines, by advice at second-hand,
by the use of means that have been recommended by
some doctor to some other woman, they would outnumber
the former ten-fold. And it must be remembered,
that most of the first class belong also to the second, as
often as they dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This testimony as to the health of English women, as
coming from a woman, is of course doubly valuable;
and it comes, too, as a mere digression in the article
from which it is quoted, the subject of which is &ldquo;Feminine
Knowledge.&rdquo; It remains yet to be proved, it seems
to us, that American women are, as a whole, suffering
from more derangement of their peculiar functions than
women of other countries. Do accurately compiled
statistics from full and trustworthy sources, warrant us
in asserting that American women are more unhealthy
than European women, or are we only assuming the fact
from their general external appearance&mdash;a criterion by
no means a certain one? In the old story, the pail of
water containing the living fish was, after all the discussion,
found to weigh about as much as the pail with
the dead one. Are we sure of our facts?</p>

<p>Or even if we are sure of these, even supposing that a
mother of a large family here is not as strong as a mother
of a large family in Germany for instance, we are in
no wise warranted in concluding that the two were not
as strong before marriage. The wear and tear of
American life must be taken into consideration, and no
one but an American housekeeper who has ever &ldquo;kept
house&rdquo; on the other side of the water, can appreciate the
immense relief from care and trouble which she has
there experienced, and the dread with which she again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
returns to the care of a house and the dealings with
servants in America. It is not work, and not weakness,
but annoyance and worry, that tire and drive women
into nervous diseases. When we find the American and
German mothers subjected to the same strain, and only
the same strain, may we fairly judge of their comparative
strength and health, and only then. Where are
the statistics concerning German women resident in this
country? There is a vast field of inquiry open on this
subject yet; in fact, a &ldquo;South-sea of discovery,&rdquo; and till
we are sure of our facts, it were well that we were cautious
in our conclusions.</p>

<p>The times are gone by when the clergyman uttered
the authoritative words of superior knowledge to an
ignorant and unquestioning audience. Every clergyman
preaches now to a congregation of critics, many of whom
are his equals, sometimes his superiors, in general information,
and who sit in judgment, more or less adequate,
on the statements he may make. In the same manner,
the days are past when the physician was the only one
who understood anything of the structure and functions
of the body, and whose prescriptions were written in an
unknown tongue. It is undeniable that the majority,
perhaps, of both men and women, are deplorably ignorant
of their structure, and the operations of the delicate
and exquisite machinery which they bear about with
them; but there is also a large number who are not so
ignorant, and who trace, with the genuine scientific
interest, the phenomena of health and disease. The
general diffusion of printed matter is rapidly diffusing
knowledge in the department of medicine, as well as in
that of theology. The elements of anatomy, physiology,
and hygiene, are taught in all our high schools and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
academies, and it is no uncommon sight to see a class of
girls handling the bones of a human skeleton, or, unmindful
of stained fingers, searching for the semi-lunar
valves in an ox's heart, with as much delight and intelligent
interest as that with which they examine the parts
of a watch or the machinery of a locomotive; while they
can sketch on the black-board, in a few minutes, the form
and relative location of all the important organs of the
body, and follow the course of the blood from left auricle
back to left auricle again, and that of the food, from
the teeth to the descending <i>vena cava</i>. And with this
basis for study already laid in school, as a part of the
common education of a woman, the latest researches and
discoveries of the wisest men and women are open to her
as well as they are to the physician, and the census
reports are at her hand; while, moreover, her knowledge
of Latin and chemistry makes plain to her the nature of
the remedies proposed in the prescription which she
gives to the apothecary.</p>

<p>As a result of our American schools, we have such
women now by the hundreds&mdash;I am not speaking of
those belonging to the medical profession&mdash;and does not
this question belong to them? As far as the records of
experience go they are ready, nay, anxious to receive
them, but they ask that these statistics shall be full in
some particulars, where they always find them deficient.</p>

<p>This girl is sick? We do not want to know simply
that she attended school, and studied and recited regularly;
we want to know also the kind of food she eats,
and how cooked, and the regularity of her meals. We
want to know the state of ventilation in the school-room
and her home; we want to know how many hours of
sleep she has, how many parties she has attended, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
underclothing she wears, the manner in which that
underclothing is arranged, the weight of her ruffled and
double box-plaited dress skirt, and its mode of support,
the thickness of the shoes habitually worn, the position
of the furnace register in the room, the kind of reading
she is allowed to have, and her standing in her class as
to thoroughness or superficiality, mental clearness or
chaos.</p>

<p>We want also to know what proportion of the cases
come from pampered, half-educated devotees of fashion,
and what proportion from well-educated, hard-working
women. When we have all these statistics, and
not till then, shall we be in a condition to attempt a
rational solution of the question, what it is that makes
our American girls sick. While endeavoring to settle
this problem, we shall not, however, forget the wise
saying of Dr. O. W. Holmes, that the Anglo-Saxon race
is not yet fully acclimated on this continent.</p>

<p>But the collection of just these statistics, so all-important,
and the want of which makes all assertion of
causes useless, is possible only to women. And, therefore,
we venture to claim that this is a woman's question&mdash;that
the women themselves are the only persons capable
of dealing with it.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> They are the only ones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
who can and do know the facts in detail, and the
facts being laid before them, can they not, with help,
possibly decide quite intelligently as to causes? They
desire any and all evidence that may be given,
but do not they themselves constitute the only
jurors competent to decide on the verdict? From the
medical profession, we get a certain amount of observed
statistics, necessarily questionable from the fact
that a large number of women are not sick, are not
good for nothing, are not childless, and, therefore, do
not consult physicians; but the reasoning which shall
judge and weigh the facts presented, assigning to each its
proper value, and, discarding unessential elements, shall
draw a just conclusion, is not limited to any profession.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>As has been before stated, out of the large number
of criticisms which I have at hand, the men, generally,
and seemingly without appreciation of its logical results,
approve of what Dr. Clarke has said; the women
of largest experience condemn, denying his premises,
disproving his clinical evidence by adding other facts,
and protesting against his conclusions.</p>

<p>The criticisms and the criticisms on criticisms would
make already quite a volume, from which perhaps the
principal lesson learned would be the correctness of
Talleyrand's idea of the use of language, as many of them
consist chiefly in the assertion that statements of the
book which appeared perfectly clear to one mind as having
a certain meaning, had in reality not that meaning
at all; and the criticisms on adverse criticisms are apt to
assert that Dr. Clarke has been accused of dishonesty by
the previous critic, when the author is quite sure that no
such accusation was expressed or intended. Most of the
points made in the criticisms have been emphasized
here.</p>

<p>The importance of the subject justifies the interest
excited, and the final effect must be good. One result is
marked; from all sections of the country, women heretofore
knowing each other only by reputation, or not at
all, are being bound together by a common interest in a
sense never before known, and unknown girls in Western
colleges are begging of women to plead for them that
they be not deprived of their places. The result need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
not be feared. The irresistible force of the world movement
cannot be permanently checked. &ldquo;The stars in
their courses fought against Sisera,&rdquo; and we would answer
the girls with the words of Santa Theresa:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Patient endurance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attaineth to all things,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>if we did not know that there is something higher, even,
than patient endurance, and so we say to them, with
Goethe, instead:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The deterioration in the health of American women is without
doubt one of the most serious among modern social problems. It

claiming far more attention.
</p><p>
&ldquo;That some of this deterioration may be due to close application to
study is possible, but the numbers of those who have ever closely
applied themselves to study is so very small, compared with the

made for causes lying deeper and spreading wider.

&ldquo;The want of success in grasping and presenting these causes

in want of knowledge of great principles of health, or in want of

mental and moral texture, would help, rather than hurt in this

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Conclusion of Majority Report to the Trustees of Cornell
University, on Mr. Sage's Proposition To Endow A
College for Women,</span></p>

<p class="hanging">Albany, February 13, 1872.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;In beginning their report, your committee stated that
their duty seemed first to be to investigate the facts
in the case separately, then to collate them, then to throw
any light thus concentrated into theories and programmes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In accordance with this plan they would conclude the
general discussion of this subject by concentrating such
light as they have been able to gain, upon the main
theory imbedded in the arguments against mixed education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The usual statement of this theory contains some
truths, some half-truths, and some errors. As ordinarily
developed, it is substantially that woman is the help-meet
of man, that she gives him aid in difficulty, counsel
in perplexity, solace in sorrow; that his is the vigorous
thinking, hers the passive reception of such portions
of thought as may be best for her; that his mind must
be trained to grapple with difficult subjects, that hers
needs no development but such as will make her directly
useful and agreeable; that the glory of man is in a
mind and heart that rejoices in solving the difficult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
problems, and fighting the worthy battles of life; that
the glory of woman is in qualities that lead her to shun
much thought on such problems, and to take little interest
in such battles; that the field of man's work may be
the mart or shop, but that it is well for him to extend
his thoughts outside it; that the field of woman is the
household, but that it is not best for her to extend her
thoughts far outside it; that man needs to be trained in
all his powers to search, to assert, to decide; that woman
needs but little training beyond that which enables her
gracefully to assent; that man needs the university and
the great subjects of study it presents, while woman
needs the 'finishing schools' and the 'accomplishments;'
and that, to sum up, the character, work, training
and position of women are as good as they ever can be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truths in this theory have covered its errors.
The truth that woman is the help-meet of man has
practically led to her education in such a way that half
her power to aid, and counsel, and comfort is taken
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The result has been that strong men, in adversity or
perplexity, have often found that the 'partners of their
joys and sorrows' give no more real strength than would
Nuremberg dolls. Under this theory, as thus worked
out, the aid, and counsel, and solace fail just when they
are most needed. In their stead, the man is likely to
find some scraps of philosophy, begun in boarding-schools,
and developed in kitchens or drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to see how a truly educated woman, nourished
on the same thoughts of the best thinkers on which
man is nourished, can give aid and counsel and solace,
while fulfilling every duty of the household, we are
happily able to appeal to the experience of many; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
for the noblest portrayal of this experience ever made
we may name the dedication to the wife of John Stuart
Mill of her husband's greatest essay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if we look out from the wants of the individual
man into the wants of the world at large, we find that
this optimist theory regarding woman is not supported
by facts, and that the resulting theory of woman's education
aggravates some of the worst evils of modern
society. One of these is conventional extravagance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the curiosities of recent civilization, perhaps
the most absurd is the vast tax laid upon all nations
at the whim of a knot of the least respectable women
in the most debauched capital in the world. The fact
may be laughed at, but it is none the less a fact, that to
meet the extravagances of the world of women who
bow to the decrees of the Br&eacute;da quarter of Paris, young
men in vast numbers, especially in our cities and large
towns, are harnessed to work as otherwise they would
not be; their best aspirations thwarted, their noblest
ambitions sacrificed, to enable the 'partners of their
joys and sorrows' to vie with each other in reproducing
the last grotesque absurdity issued from the precincts
of <i>Notre Dame de Lorette</i>, or to satisfy other caprices
not less ignoble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The main hope for the abatement of this nuisance,
which is fast assuming the proportions of a curse, is
not in any church; for, despite the pleadings of the
most devoted pastors, the church edifices are the chosen
theatres of this display; it would seem rather to be in
the infusion, by a more worthy education, of ideas
which would enable woman to wield religion, morality,
and common sense against this burdensome perversion
of her love for the beautiful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This would not be to lower the sense of beauty and
appropriateness in costume; thereby would come an
&aelig;sthetic sense, which would lift our best women into a
sphere of beauty where Parisian grotesque could not be
tolerated; thereby, too, would come, if at all, the strength
of character which would cause woman to cultivate her
own taste for simple beauty in form and color, and to
rely on that, rather than on the latest whim of any
foolish woman who happens to be not yet driven out of
the Tuileries or the Br&eacute;da quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still another evil in American women is the want of
any general appreciation of art in its nobler phases.
The number of those who visit the museums of art is
wretchedly small, compared with the crowds in the
temples of haberdashery. Even the love of art they
have is tainted with 'Parisian fashions.' The painting
which makes fortunes is not the worthy representation
of worthy subjects; French boudoir paintings take the
place of representations of what is grand in history or
beautiful in legend; Wilhems and his satin dresses,
Bourgereau with his knack at flesh-color, have driven
out of memory the noble treatment of great themes
by Ary Scheffer and Paul Delaroche; Kaulbach is
eclipsed by Meissonier. Art is rapidly becoming merely
a means of parlor decoration, and losing its function as
the embodiment of great truths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So rapidly evaporates one of the most potent influences
for good in a republic. An education of women,
looking to something more than accomplishments, is
necessary to create a healthy reaction against this tendency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still another part of woman's best and noblest influence
has an alloy which education of a higher sort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
under influences calculated to develop logical thought,
might remove. For one of the most decided obstacles
to progress of the best Christian thought and right
reason has arisen from the clinging of women to old
abuses, and the fear of new truths. From Mary Stuart,
at the castle of Ambroise, to the last good woman who
has shrieked against science&mdash;from the Camarilla which
prays and plots for reaction in every European court
down to the weakest hunter of the mildest heresies in
remote villages, the fetichisms and superstitions of this
world are bolstered up mainly by women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Lessing's great picture, the good, kind-faced woman
whose simplicity Huss blesses as she eagerly heaps up
the fagots for his martyrdom, is but the type of vast
multitudes of mothers of the race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The greatest aid which could be rendered to smooth
the way for any noble thinkers who are to march through
the future, would be to increase the number of women
who, by an education which has caught something from
manly methods, are prevented from clinging to advancing
thinkers, or throwing themselves hysterically across
their pathway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, too, that indirect influence of women on political
events, so lauded even by those who are most opposed
to any exercise by her of direct influence, has some bad
qualities which a better system of education might
diminish. The simple historical record shows that in
what Bacon calls the 'insanity of states,' her influence
has generally been direful. From Catherine de Medicis
in the struggle of the League, down to Louise Michel,
in the recent catastrophe at Paris&mdash;from the <i>tricoteuses</i>
of the first French Revolution to the <i>p&eacute;troleuses</i> of the
last, woman has seemed to aggravate rather than soothe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
popular fury. Nor is the history of civil strife nearer
home, without parallel examples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An education which would lead women to a more
thoughtful consideration of great questions and more
logical treatment of them, would, perhaps, do something
to aid mercy and justice in the world at those very times
when they are most imperiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to all this it may be said that these considerations
are too general and remote&mdash;that woman's most immediate
duties relate to maternity, and that her most beautiful
mission relates to the dispensing of charities. As to
her duties as mother, if the subject were fully discussed,
it would be shown that, under the present system of
physical, mental, and moral education of women, there
is a toleration of perhaps the most cancerous evil of
modern society. Suffice it that the system of education
proposed cannot make it worse, and may make it better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to woman's beautiful function as the dispenser of
charities, it will do no harm to have leading minds among
women shown, as a stronger education would show them,
that systems of charity based on impulse and not on
reason have in older countries caused almost as much
misery as they have cured. Her work in charity would
be certainly strengthened by the training which would
give her insight into this.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Extracts from the Report of the President of Michigan
University For the Year 1872</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number of women who are availing themselves
of the opportunity to study at the University is nearly
twice as great as it was in the year 1870-71. The number
registered then was 34, viz.: 2 in the Law Department;
18 in the Medical Department, and 14 in the
Academic Department. This year the number has been
64, viz.: 3 in the Law Department; 33 in the Medical,
and 28 in the Academic. These last are distributed
in the classes as follows: Seniors, 2; Sophomores, 7;
Freshmen, 13; in select courses, 6. Of those in the
regular courses, eight are Classical students, nine Latin
and Scientific, and five Scientific. Five of those in the
select courses are giving their attention chiefly to scientific
studies and modern languages and literature; the
sixth to classical work. Six women graduated in April
with the medical class, one with the law class, and two
now graduate in the Academic Department. In the
Medical Department the women have received instruction
by themselves, except in chemistry. In the other
Departments all instruction is given to both sexes in
common.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is manifestly not wise to leap to hasty generalizations
from our brief experience in furnishing education
to both sexes in our University. But I think all who
have been familiar with the inner life of the University
for the past two years, will admit that, thus far, no reason
for doubting the wisdom of the Regents' action in opening
the University to women has appeared. Hardly one
of the many embarrassments which some feared, has
confronted us. The young women have addressed themselves
to their work with great zeal, and have shown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
themselves quite capable of meeting the demands of
severe studies as successfully as their classmates of the
other sex. Their work so far does not evince less variety
of aptitude or less power of grappling even with
higher mathematics than we find in the young men.
They receive no favors, and desire none. They are subjected
to precisely the same tests as the men. Some of
them, like the men, have stumbled at examinations; but
nearly all of them have maintained a most creditable
reputation for scholarship in every branch of study
which has awaited them in their course. Nor does their
work seem to put a dangerous strain upon their physical
powers. They assure me that they never enjoyed better
health, and their absences by reason of sickness do not
proportionately exceed those of the men. Their presence
has not called for the enactment of a single new law, or
for the slightest change in our methods of government
or grade of work. If we are asked still to regard the
reception of women into our classes as an experiment,
it must certainly be deemed a most hopeful experiment.
The numerous inquiries which are sent to me from various
parts of this country, and even from England, concerning
the results of their admission to the University,
show that a profound and wide-spread interest in
the subject has been awakened. Cornell University has
recently decided to open its doors to women, and it can
hardly be doubted that other conspicuous Eastern colleges
will soon follow the example. The Alumni and
Trustees of at least four prominent New England colleges
are formally considering the subject.&rdquo;</p>


<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">From Report for</span> 1873.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number of women who enroll themselves as stu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>dents
in the University continues to increase. Two
years ago it was 37; in 1871-2 it was 64; in 1872-3 it
was 88. The attendance of women was, by departments,
as follows: in the Law Department 4; in the
Medical Department 40; in the Academic Department
45. These last were, according to the Calendar, distributed
as follows: Resident Graduates 2; Senior Class
1; Junior Class 7; Sophomore Class 8; Freshmen
Class 20; Select Course 5; Pharmacy 2. Of the 35 in
the regular courses of study, 14 pursue the Classical, 14
the Latin and Scientific, and 7 the Scientific. Of the
graduates, 8 are women; 1 in the Law Department, 1
in the Literary, and 6 in the Medical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The history of our work during the past year has only
deepened the impression made during the two previous
years, of the entire practicability of imparting collegiate
and professional education to the two sexes in the same
schools. If any have cherished a fear that the admission
of women would tend to reduce the standard of work in
the University, their attention may be directed to the
fact that during the last three years we have been
steadily increasing the requirements for admission and
broadening the range of studies. Now certainly the
women experience no such difficulty in acquiring the
studies assigned in the regular curriculum as to call for
any modification of the course on their account. Their
record is as creditable in all branches as that of their
classmates of the other sex. Nor do I see any evidence
that their success in their intellectual pursuits is purchased
at the expense of health. On the contrary, I
doubt if an equal number of young women in any other
pursuit in life have been in better health during the
year. I am persuaded, that with ordinary care and pru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>dence,
any one of our courses of study may be completed
by a young woman of fair ability without undue draft
upon her strength. None of the many objections, which
are still raised against the co-education of the sexes, have
thus been found in practice here to have any force. The
admission of women has led to no new difficulty or embarrassment
in the administration of the Institution. It
has certainly brought to a large class the benefits of such
an education as otherwise would have been out of their
reach, and has awakened through the State and the
country, and even in foreign lands, a new interest in
the University.&rdquo;</p>
